# Part 1: Brand Positioning

## Exercise 01 — Brand Journey Framework

### Desired Outcome

Build a community around E.I. Werner as a fantasy writer and creator that makes the writing career financially sustainable and less lonely. The room full of people who choose to care about the things you've been doing alone for 18 years. Motivate people to full send on their own dreams through the undimmed passion of an 18-year grind with almost nothing to show for it — and give fantasy lovers a front-row seat to how the work actually gets made, with real opportunities to engage and contribute along the way. So that when the books are ready, the audience is already there and already cares.

### Reputation Requirement

E.I. Werner is a writer. Writes every day.

### Required Actions

- Three scheduled writing streams per week (the backbone — proves "writer who writes every day")
- One scheduled gaming stream per week (community building, personality, connection)
- Casual gaming streams whenever the energy is there
- Monthly public update videos (the rooting interest recruitment tool — not gated)
- Share worldbuilding, lore, creation myths, and craft openly. Keep the actual narrative of Only Us protected until it's ready.

### Learning Gaps

- Social media strategy and execution (knowledge gap — learnable)
- Comfort on camera (experiential gap — requires reps, not study. Confidence is there, warmup period expected)

---

## Exercise 02 — Credibility Bank

### Wins

1. **Kinfire Chronicles** — Published creative work. Wrote quests for a tabletop game that Kickstarted, shipped to acclaim. Characters survived multiple expansions.
2. **Kept got an agent** — Wrote the first book of a fantasy trilogy plus an outline for the rest, good enough to land literary representation and go out to every major publisher.
3. **The 18-year body of work** — Decided at 15 he'd be a fantasy author. Has written nearly every day since. Multiple completed projects: Kept (book + trilogy outline), Only Us (trilogy in progress), ONCE (six creation myths), Marathon (screenplay). The streak is the win.

### Scars

1. **Kept was rejected by every major publisher — and he retired it.** Not just a rejection story — a taste and standards story. He came to believe it didn't deserve to be published and started over.
2. **MARATHON** the movie script about the first ever Marathon runner in ancient Athens and the first imperfect democracy has had two agents and many rejections. Contains many mythic references, undertones, and research.
3. **Sacrificed a normal life for this.** No relationships prioritized, friends at arm's length, texts unanswered, 18 years of grip. The cost is real and he's aware of it. "I'd rather die than give up and do the mundane tech life thing."

### Shareability Ratings

| Credibility Item | Rating | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kinfire Chronicles | 🟢 Green | Published, public, shareable freely |
| Kept got an agent | 🟢 Green | Provable, impressive, no downside |
| 18-year writing streak | 🟢 Green | The anchor of the whole brand |
| Kept rejected and retired | 🟢 Green | Honest and shows standards |
| Marathon script — flown to LA, nothing happened | 🟡 Yellow | Share the experience, not the collaboration dynamics |
| Sacrificed a normal life | 🟢 Green | Ready to share openly |

---

## Exercise 03 — Interest Bank

### Curiosities (Actively Learning)

1. Creation stories across all philosophies, religions, and sciences
2. AI in writing — using it as a voice/sounding board, never for the actual writing, but checks his work
3. Streaming — becoming a content creator and personality online
4. Gaming — always pursuing some gaming goal
5. Trying to financially make it as an artist
6. Founding myths research — how creation stories affect the ethics of nations
7. Music curation and production — built an original lo-fi music catalog with a contract composer, exploring how to release and use it
8. Book club with Vanderbilt friends — currently reading The Odyssey

### Experiments (Actively Testing)

1. **WoW machinima** — writing script, taking in-game footage. Three episodes planned, first script mostly written. New medium, unknown outcome. Not sure the juice will be worth the squeeze on this one but very interested.
2. **Working with artists on the EIW stream and brand.** Visual artists (Marwan, Luiz) and musicians (Carson). Some collaborations failed, others have succeeded. Learning to lead a creative team as a founder.
3. **Invented base-7 numeral system** — building a functional system from scratch for the fantasy world

### Live Questions

1. How do I support myself as an artist and not have to grind on tech all day?
2. What will I do with my myths once they're done besides writing the trilogy? Can I put them into the world somehow?
3. Will people understand what I'm trying to do with the myths? Not everyone, but enough?
4. Can I actually balance a stream, writing, and possibly tech work?
5. What does life look like when I stop clutching my dream so tight? What girl might I meet, what kind of friend or brother would I be?
6. Will I be OK? I know I won't stop trying but I have nothing to show for it.

### Early Signals & Observations

1. "I'd rather die than give up and live a pedestrian, tech-guy life. Not because I don't think it can be beautiful but because I know that isn't who I am. That isn't who I am meant to be." — starting to see his own stubbornness as evidence of something rather than just coping. There is no turning the ship around. Full steam ahead.
2. Undervalues relationships and doesn't think he can change right now. One reason he's going to Athens — hard to be so focused and not care about people who want to care about him. Hard to reassure others and justify my work when it is hard enough to remain solid and motivated on my own.
3. A bit naive — was at SKIMS, seeing it in some early business dealings with collaborators already. Concerned about the pattern.
4. No external validation yet — but seven months ago he had nothing. Now: LLC, composer under contract, animator on deadline, launch date set, screenplay out to directors.

## Exercise 04 — Brand Prison Test

### Dread Test

Being known only as "the WoW guy." WoW is a tool, not the center of the brand. Gaming is part of life, not the whole identity. Writer first, everything else second.

### Core Subjects (All Pass Three Filters)

1. **Writing** (his own) — anchor subject
2. **Trying to make it** — the emotional engine
3. **Games** — community glue
4. **Comparative mythology / monomyths** — the differentiator. "The timeless truths beneath the cultural tides."

### Human Layer Inventory

| Item | Rating | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cool kid who chose the nerdy path — handsome, tall, could be (and has been) popular but doesn't try | 🟢 | Distinctive, authentic, shows up naturally |
| Surfer, Costa Rica winters, barefoot lifestyle | 🟢 | Vivid, memorable, makes him real |
| Loner who judges himself by his own standards | 🟢 | This IS the brand |
| Journey from Orthodox Judaism → radical open-mindedness | 🟡 | Share when time is right — connects directly to the mythology work |

### Prison Test

"If my brand stayed exactly the same for the next 5 years, I would feel: **Better than what I have now. On my terms. Proud of myself.**" Not a prison.

### The Reframe

"I am not building a brand to please the algorithm. I am building a brand that gives me the room full of people I've never had — people who chose to care about the things I've been doing alone for 18 years."

---

## Exercise 05 — Painful Problems

### Customer Context

"My ideal viewer is someone who deeply loves fantasy and/or gaming but has had to downplay that part of themselves. They're thoughtful, productive, and a little tired of feeling like their interests need defending."

### Three Audiences

1. **Fantasy lovers** who want permission and sophistication
2. **Productive gamers** who want to stop apologizing
3. **Writers in the trenches** who want to feel less alone

**Connective tissue across all three:** People who love something deeply and feel isolated inside that love.

### Final Pain List (16 Problems)

**Fantasy Lovers:**

1. "I can't explain to people why fantasy matters without sounding childish."
2. "My favorite author hasn't finished the series and I'm losing hope."
3. "I feel like there's nothing good left to read in fantasy."
4. "I love something deeply but can't articulate why it hits me so hard."
5. "I want fantasy that's sophisticated, not corny."
6. "I've outgrown most fantasy content creators — they feel juvenile."
7. "I wish I could watch someone build a fantasy world instead of just reviewing others'."
8. "I want to support independent creators but most feel amateur or cringe."

**Productive Gamers:**

9. "I feel guilty about how much time I spend gaming."
10. "I'm ambitious and productive but people assume gamers are lazy."

**Writers in the Trenches:**

11. "I'm grinding at something nobody believes in yet and I feel alone in it."
12. "I don't have anyone in my life who wants to go deep on this stuff with me."
13. "Nobody in my life understands what I've sacrificed to be a writer."
14. "I gave up on writing because the cost was too much and I think about it all the time."
15. "I want to be a writer but I have no idea what it actually takes."
16. "I haven't finished my book and I don't know anyone else in the same boat who's still going."

### Top 5 — Cost of Inaction

| Problem | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Gaming guilt | They slowly stop doing something they love. Lose a source of joy and community. |
| Can't defend fantasy | Keep downplaying a core part of their identity. Quiet self-betrayal. |
| No one to go deep with | Loneliness inside something they're passionate about. |
| Nothing good left in fantasy | Disengage from the genre entirely. Drift from something that shaped them. |
| Can't articulate why they love something | Feel inarticulate about the thing they care most about. Frustrating and isolating. |

**Root:** Almost every cost comes back to people shrinking away from something they love because they don't have the language, the community, or the permission to stay in it fully. E.I. Werner gives them the room where they don't have to shrink.

---

## Exercise 06 — Differentiation Breakdown

| What People Say/Do That I Disagree With | My Brand Approach |
| --- | --- |
| "Write what you know" | Write what you can *see*. Imagination is the point. You might see something that has never existed yet. |
| "I don't have time to write, I have a job" | I wrote through every serious job I've ever had. You make time or you don't. |
| Perfectionism on the first draft | Get it out of you first. Perfection comes later. |
| Holding up Sanderson-speed as the standard | That's an extreme outlier. Some of us labor for years. That's not failure — that's the work. |
| "Just get it out there, don't obsess" | Obsession is what makes your writing different from everyone else's. |
| Writing for sex, fame, or money | Write for readers. And for you. That's it. |
| Magic systems that are just mechanics | Magic should change how people interact, their ethics, their values. |
| "Worldbuilding doesn't matter, only character" | False binary. Both matter. They feed each other. |
| Tolkien as the ceiling | He's the foundation AND the ceiling. Build on him, don't just worship him. |
| Only valuing bestsellers OR only valuing niche art | It has to be both. Reach and craft aren't enemies. |
| Post constantly even if it's bad | Quality and honesty over volume. |
| Streaming 80 hours a week | Not healthy. Not me. |
| Only playing what the audience wants | You have to experiment and take risks or it gets stale. |
| Sweaty tryhards who tilt and stop having fun | Games are supposed to be fun. Set goals but enjoy the pursuit. |

**Thread:** Obsession that stays honest. All-in without losing the reason you started.

---

## Exercise 07 — Desired Associations

### For

1. **Obsession with craft that never loses its soul** — he cares more than anyone and it's pure
2. **Permission to love what you love without apology** — fantasy, gaming, the nerdy life, all of it
3. **Endurance over heroics** — this is a long grind, not a sprint. Show up every day for years.

### Against

1. **Content for content's sake** — volume without substance, writing for fame instead of readers
2. **The idea that fantasy and gaming are lesser interests** — not escapism, not childish, not a waste of time
3. **Complaining instead of adapting** — don't hate the game, get better. Applies to gaming and life.

---

## Exercise 08 — Brand Statement

> **"Writing, fantasy, and games are not escapes. They are destinations."**

### Supporting Beliefs

- Pure passion, pure belly fire, is very rare and very precious and even divine.
- You should full send in pursuit of those things.
- The test of passion's purity is *why* you are doing it. If it's fame, money, algorithms, or you can't articulate it, you're lost. If it's because you earnestly love it, you are found.
- If you want to be exceptional, it demands sacrifice. And sacrifice means it's something that hurts to give up.

---

## Key Brand Identity Notes

**Who E.I. Werner is to the audience:** A writer who is going for it. Has been going for it for 18 years. More talented than his resume indicates. You're early in recognizing it. His passion is so pure it may charge you up.

**What the audience gets:** The room where they don't have to shrink. Permission. Sophistication. A front-row seat to the work. Community with people who chose to care.

**What the brand solves:** The loneliness of loving something deeply and having no one to share it with.

**What separates EIW from everyone else:** 18 years of undimmed passion with almost nothing to show for it — and he's still going. Not performing. Not posturing. Just doing the work.

---

# Part 2: Content Strategy

---

## Exercise 09 — Sustainable Foundation

### Actual Time

- **Launch phase (March 3 — May 15):** Full-time availability. 4 streams/week plus content creation, learning, reps.
- **Sustainable phase (May 15+):** 3 writing streams/week (which double as the writing itself), 1 gaming stream, a few hours for admin. Social media and editing need to be outsourced when financially possible.
- **Key insight:** The writing streams don't steal time from the work — they ARE the work. That's why the sustainable system holds.

### Energy Mapping

- **Gives energy:** Writing, gaming, talking to people online
- **Drains energy:** Video editing, posting on social media, finances, negotiations
- **Outsource first:** Editing and social media posting

### Realistic Cadence

**Floor (never goes below this):**

- 3 writing streams/week
- 1 gaming stream/week
- 1 monthly update video (not a separate production — a reflection on what happened in the streams)

**Launch bonus (March — May):**

- Short-form clips from streams (3-5/week)
- Active social media posting

### Freshness Window

- Mornings after workout
- Writing streams first, transition to games

### Environment

- Facecam at desk
- Books behind him
- Notion and AI on screen share
- Stream Deck for switching views
- Long-term vision: a proper study with all his books and quality equipment
- Short-term reality: parents' house then Athens rental — don't let the imperfect setup stop the launch

### Commitment

"For the next 12-18 months, I commit to streaming 4 days a week and posting on social media because it supports my business, not because it sounds impressive."

---

## Exercise 10 — Platforms

| Platform | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **YouTube** | Primary — VODs, update videos, machinima, long-form home base. |
| **Twitch** | Secondary — live streams, community interaction, gaming culture |
| **TikTok** | Short-form distribution — clipped from streams |
| **Instagram** (750 followers) | Short-form distribution — clipped from streams |
| **YouTube Shorts** | Short-form distribution — clipped from streams |

Short-form platforms get repurposed content only — no original creation for them. This is the first thing to hand to an editor.

---

## Exercise 11 — Ideation Table

| Painful Problem | Your Unique Solution | Your Credibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "I feel guilty about gaming" | You don't have to. I'm 33, hyper-productive, and game constantly. It's community, not waste. | 18 years of writing every day while gaming the whole time. Living proof. |
| "Nothing good left in fantasy" | There is — and I'm making some of it. Let me show you what I'm building and why. | Writing Only Us and ONCE. Studied creation myths across every tradition. |
| "Can't explain why fantasy matters" | Fantasy isn't escape — it's destination. It articulates truths that only stories can reach. | Brand statement + comparative mythology research + ONCE |
| "I wish I could watch someone build a fantasy world" | You can. I stream it live 3x/week. Notion open, AI helper visible, all of it. | The streams themselves are the proof |
| "Nobody understands what I've sacrificed to write" | I do. Here's what it cost me and why I kept going. | 18 years, no relationships prioritized, still going |
| "Can't articulate why I love something so deeply" | The reason it hits you is because great fantasy touches truths truer than truth. I'll give you the language. | Comparative mythology work. ONCE. The monomyth research. |
| "My favorite author hasn't finished the series" | I know the frustration. And I'm building mine in front of you so you can hold me accountable. | Kept retirement + starting over with Only Us. Seen the cost of caring about quality. |
| "I want sophisticated fantasy, not corny" | Same. Magic should change ethics and values, not just shoot fireballs. Worldbuilding and character aren't a binary. | The base-7 numeral system. The creation myths. The depth of the world being built. |
| "I've outgrown most fantasy content creators" | Because most of them review and rank. I'm actually making something. | Active writer, not a commentator. Building the world live. |
| "I want to support independent creators but most feel amateur or cringe" | The brand is elevated. No wordmarks on merch. Quality equipment. Tasteful everything. You won't be embarrassed to share this. | The design standard across all assets. The study setup vision. The standard he holds. |
| "I'm ambitious and productive but people assume gamers are lazy" | I surf, write every day, built an LLC, run a team, and game constantly. The two coexist. | The full resume of productivity alongside lifelong gaming. |
| "I don't have anyone to go deep with on this stuff" | That's what this community is. The room where you don't have to shrink. | Built this because he had the same problem. |
| "I gave up on writing and think about it all the time" | I almost understand that. I never could give up but I know how dark it gets. Come watch someone who didn't stop. | Kept rejected. Marathon stalled. Still writing every morning. |
| "I want to be a writer but have no idea what it actually takes" | I'll show you. Live. The real cost, the real work, no sugarcoating. | 18 years of it. The sacrifice scar. The daily proof on stream. |
| "I haven't finished my book and don't know anyone still going" | I haven't finished mine either. I'm still going. You're not alone in this. | Only Us in progress. ONCE in progress. The grind is visible. |
| "I'm grinding at something nobody believes in yet and I feel alone" | So am I. That's why this exists. | Everything. The whole story. |

---

## Exercise 12 — Wrapping Paper Library

**System:** Notion database with columns for Screenshot/Link, Platform, Why It Caught Your Eye, Date Saved.

**Sources:** YouTube titles/thumbnails, TikTok/Reels hooks, [1of10.com](http://1of10.com/), cross-industry inspiration (gaming, fitness, cooking, documentary — anywhere outside your niche).

**Habit:** 20-30 minutes once a week. Don't judge, just collect. 50-60% of even the wildest screenshots eventually find a use.

**Rule:** Build the library before you need it. When you NEED packaging is when it's hardest to find.

---

## Exercise 13 — 4C's Intro Framework

### Default E.I. Werner Version

| Element | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Call Out** | Who is this for? | Fantasy lovers, gamers, writers in the trenches — people who love something deeply and are tired of shrinking |
| **Credibility** | Why should they listen? | 18 years writing every day. Agent for a trilogy. Published game writer. Still going with almost nothing to show for it. |
| **Compass** | Where are we going? | Here's the problem, here's where we're headed, come with me |
| **Core Learning** | Give them something valuable immediately | A belief shift or reframe — delivered in the first 60 seconds |

### Channel Intro — "You're Already There" (Final)

> Ho traveler,
>
> I'm E.I. Werner and I've been an aspiring fantasy author for 18 years. I've written a lot. Quests for a board game, a period epic screenplay, and a fantasy novel that landed an agent and took real shots. But I don't have much to show for it. People wonder why I haven't quit. I've wondered it myself.
>
> And the truth is, it's because I can't. There's a dream in me that has to come out — to build one of the places I see in my head and take people there. Because writing, fantasy, and video games are not escapes. They're destinations.
>
> And this channel is one of them. Not a castle in the sky — not yet. But the long, dusty road to get there. So welcome. And congratulations. Because when you're here, you're already there.

**"When you're here, you're already there."** — Sign-off line. Protect it. Use it to close every stream.

---

## Exercise 14 — Waterfall Distribution

### Content Tiers

| Tier | What It Is | Where It Goes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tier 1 — Raw VOD** | Full unedited stream. The silence, the typing, the process. | Twitch (lives naturally). YouTube as separate playlist for core community. |
| **Tier 2 — Edited VOD** | Same stream, dead space cut, tightened. Best moments of thinking, breakthroughs, worldbuilding. | YouTube as main upload. This is the recruitment tool. |
| **Tier 3 — Clips** | Best 30-60 second self-contained moments. | TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts |
| **Monthly Update** | Sit down, reflect on the month's streams. What moved, what's hard. | YouTube |

### Outsourcing Package

One editor's job: take raw stream → produce edited VOD → pull clips. One person, one workflow, three outputs. First hire when money allows.

### Launch Phase (Doing It Yourself)

Keep it simple. One or two clips per stream. Don't try for five. Increase later or hand it off.

---

## Exercise 15 — First Three Videos

### Video 1: The Introduction

- **What:** "You're Already There" — the 18-year story, the pivotal moments, the cost, the invitation. Close with what the channel is and who it's for.
- **Format:** Talking to camera. The writing audition — if the words are good, nobody needs to be told you're a writer.
- **Opening:** The finalized "You're Already There" intro script (see Exercise 13)
- **Structure:**
  1. Opening (the 4C's intro — finalized)
  2. Deciding at 15 — Lesson: deciding is different from wanting
  3. Kept getting an agent, rejected everywhere, retiring it — Lesson: getting close isn't making it, having standards means killing your own work
  4. The sacrifice — Lesson: exceptional demands sacrifice, and sacrifice means something that hurts to give up
  5. Still here — Lesson: the test isn't talent, it's whether you're still going
  6. Close with expectations: what this channel is, what they'll see, who it's for

### Video 2: The Myth Project

- **What:** Why you're writing six creation myths and what fantasy actually is. The contrarian belief in full. Hint at the septimal system.
- **Format:** Deep dive, 25+ minutes. Positioning video.
- **Core:** ONCE is the vehicle — it IS the contrarian belief made tangible. Not just saying fantasy is a destination — building the foundation of one from the ground up.

### Video 3: Making the Machinima

- **What:** Behind-the-scenes of building WoW machinima Episode 1. Learning a new medium in public.
- **Format:** Process/building-in-public experiment. Tests whether people enjoy watching you make things, not just hearing you talk about making things.
- **Note:** Release the actual machinima Episode 1 as its own separate piece when it's ready. The process video builds anticipation.

## Brand Summary

**Brand Statement:** "Writing, fantasy, and games are not escapes. They are destinations."

**Sign-off:** "When you're here, you're already there."

**The Brand in One Paragraph:** E.I. Werner is a fantasy writer 18 years into the grind with almost nothing to show for it — and he's still going. He streams his writing live, plays games with his community, and builds his fantasy world in public. The brand exists because he's been doing this alone for almost two decades and wants the room full of people he's never had. For fantasy lovers who've had to downplay what they love, gamers tired of apologizing for their passion, and writers in the trenches who feel alone — this is the place where you don't have to shrink. Not escapes. Destinations.

---

## Outside Inn — Role in the EIW Ecosystem

Outside Inn is not a separate brand. It is a place within the E.I. Werner world — the community's gathering space and atmospheric identity.

**What it is now:**

- **Stream atmosphere.** The lo-fi animation (by Marwan) and original music (by Carson) play as warmup and cooldown for every EIW stream. Patron names scroll during these segments. It sets the tone and rewards membership visually.
- **Discord identity.** The Discord server is called The Outside Inn. The inn is the conceptual frame for the community — warm, inviting, a place people return to.
- **Merch line.** Outside Inn-themed products (deskmats, mousepads, posters) live in the Fourthwall store alongside EIW products. Two visual aesthetics, one store.
- **Music catalog.** Roughly an album's worth of original lo-fi tracks composed by Carson Thatcher. These play during streams and may be released as a standalone album. Potential future uses: royalty-free licensing for Innkeeper members, Spotify/Bandcamp release, background music for EIW YouTube content.

**What it is not:**

- Not a separate streaming channel.
- Not a 24/7 radio station.
- Not a separate brand with its own audience pipeline.

**The lesson:** The original vision was a standalone lo-fi radio station — a separate channel, separate brand, separate audience funnel. The brand positioning work revealed that splitting energy between two brands was counterproductive to the core goal: building a community around E.I. Werner as a writer. The music, animation, and creative investment are real and valuable — they just serve the EIW channel now instead of competing with it for attention.

**Visual mismatch (known, accepted):** EIW's visual identity is black and white, painterly, literary. Outside Inn's is warm pixel art and lo-fi atmosphere. These don't match perfectly. That's fine for v1. The quality of both is high, and cohesion can evolve.

<!-- TODO: Confirm Carson's contract allows royalty-free use by Innkeeper members and/or album release rights. -->
<!-- TODO: Decide on album release timeline and whether to commission 1-2 additional tracks to round out the catalog. -->

# Part 3: Monetization & Fourthwall Strategy

---

## Platform Choice — Fourthwall

Everything runs through **Fourthwall** — memberships, merch, and the storefront. One platform, one brand experience, one URL.

### Why Fourthwall over Patreon

| Factor | Fourthwall | Patreon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Platform fee** | 5% + payment processing | 10% standard for new creators + payment processing |
| **Branding** | Fully white-label. Custom domain, your logo, your colors. No platform branding anywhere. | Always patreon.com/username with Patreon's UI and navigation visible. |
| **Merch integration** | Built-in store with print-on-demand, custom products, and member-only discounts per tier. 0% platform fee on physical products. | No native merch store. Third-party add-on costs an additional 3% of all monthly earnings. |
| **Twitch integration** | Twitch Gifting (gift memberships and merch to chat), Twitch subscriber discounts, on-stream alerts via FourthwallHQ bot. | No native Twitch integration whatsoever. |
| **Member discounts** | Any percentage, per tier, auto-applied at checkout. | No native tier-based merch discounts. |
| **Loyalty badges** | Built-in subscription streak badges. | No native loyalty badges. |
| **Mobile experience** | Branded Progressive Web App (PWA) — no 30% Apple App Store surcharge. | Native app — but Apple takes 30% on iOS subscriptions outside the US. |
| **Discoverability** | None. Traffic comes from your streams, YouTube, and social media. | Explore page and recommendations exist, but 75%+ of patron acquisition still comes from creator promotion. |
| **Community chat** | DMs only (1:1, creator-initiated). No group chat. | Community chats (up to 10 rooms) and member-to-creator DMs. |

**Bottom line:** Fourthwall saves roughly $3,500/year at 500 members versus Patreon, delivers the white-label branding this brand demands, and is the only platform with Twitch Gifting. Patreon's community chat advantage is real but irrelevant — Discord handles community, Signal handles the inner circle.

### Revenue Stack

| Source | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Fourthwall memberships** | Primary recurring revenue — Traveler ($7.77) and Innkeeper ($21.21) tiers |
| **Fourthwall merch store** | Product revenue — EIW and Outside Inn-themed product lines |
| **Twitch subscriptions** | Secondary recurring revenue — Fourthwall Twitch sub discounts incentivize members to sub on both |
| **YouTube ad revenue** | Passive — grows with viewership |
| **Expert network calls** | Bridge income — sporadic at $399/hour, unpredictable but meaningful when they come |

## Membership Tiers

### Two Tiers. $7.77 / $21.21. The sevens run deep.

The pricing is intentional. Base-7 runs through the entire fantasy world — the septimal numeral system, the creation myths, the lore. The prices carry that DNA. $7.77 is elevated enough to not feel like a tip jar. $21.21 (3×7, mirrored decimal) is a real commitment that justifies real access. Nearly 3x jump between tiers, justified by clear value differentiation.

---

### Tier 1 — "Traveler" | $7.77/month

*The community. The room where you don't have to shrink.*

- **Discord exclusive channels** — open Discord is the lobby, this is the real room. Behind-the-scenes worldbuilding, writing process, direct interaction.
- **Early access to all YouTube videos** — VODs, update videos, machinima, everything drops here first.
- **Name displayed during Outside Inn warmup** — your name scrolls during the lo-fi warmup at the top of every stream. Ties membership to the stream experience.
- **Septimal loyalty badges** — evolving Discord badges on a base-7 cycle (month 1, month 7, month 14, etc.). Visible loyalty. Collectible. Costs nothing to deliver.
- **7% merch discount** on all Fourthwall store items.
- **Community polls** — vote on gaming stream games, worldbuilding deep-dive topics, etc.

---

### Tier 2 — "Innkeeper" | $21.21/month

*The inner circle. Everything above, plus:*

- **Monthly patron-only livestream** — 45-60 minutes, casual, AMA-style. The intimate hangout. Not the performance — the conversation.
- **Signal group thread** — you drop what you're working on, share late-night screenshots of paragraphs, post thoughts in real time. The backstage group chat. Not Discord — this lives on their phone. Discord is the town square. The Signal group is the back table at the inn.
- **Name in video credits** — on screen at the end of every YouTube upload. Small list, each name means something.
- **Royalty-free Outside Inn music use** — members can use Outside Inn tracks in their own content (streams, videos, projects). A real differentiator for creators in the audience. <!-- ⚠️ REVISIT: Requires confirmation that Carson's contract allows this. -->
- **Exclusive merch drops** — limited designs only available to Innkeepers. On-brand, scarce, elevated.
- **14% merch discount** on all Fourthwall store items.
- **Writing review after 7 consecutive months** — review up to one chapter (≈2,000 words) of their writing, privately or on stream — their choice. The 7-month loyalty gate is the natural throttle. This is earned, not purchased. As the queue grows, batch into on-stream review sessions — which doubles as content.

---

### Founding Member Badge

Available to anyone who joins either tier in the first 90 days (March 3 – June 3, 2026):

- Permanent "Founding Member" badge in Discord
- Name on a permanent Founders page on the Fourthwall site
- Never comes back. First 90 days only.

### Perk Scalability Matrix

| Perk | Marginal cost per new member | Scales? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discord channels | Zero | ✅ |
| Early video access | Zero | ✅ |
| Name on Outside Inn warmup | Zero (automated scroll) | ✅ |
| Septimal badges | Zero (set up once) | ✅ |
| Merch discount | Zero (margin reduction only on purchase) | ✅ |
| Polls | Zero | ✅ |
| Monthly livestream | Zero (same stream regardless of 10 or 100 viewers) | ✅ |
| Signal group thread | Near-zero (one group, you post when you post) | ✅ |
| Name in credits | Zero | ✅ |
| Music licensing | Zero (same license applies) | ✅ |
| Exclusive merch | Zero (print on demand) | ✅ |
| Writing review (7mo gate) | ~30-45 min per review | ⚠️ Throttled by loyalty gate |

Every perk scales except the writing review, and that's throttled by design.

### Conservative Revenue Projections

| Period | Travelers | Innkeepers | Monthly Gross | After Fourthwall 5% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Month 1-2 | 30 | 5 | ~$340 | ~$323 |
| Month 3-4 | 60 | 10 | ~$680 | ~$646 |
| Month 5-6 | 100 | 20 | ~$1,200 | ~$1,140 |

Combined with Twitch subs, YouTube ad revenue, and merch sales — the financial picture improves as the community grows. The priority is building the community. Revenue follows from that, not the other way around. September 1, 2026 is the checkpoint to evaluate traction and decide next steps from a position of strength.

## Community Architecture

### Discord — The Outside Inn

The Discord server is called **The Outside Inn** — the community gathering place within the EIW brand. The inn is the conceptual home: warm, inviting, a place travelers return to. The name carries the investment in custom pixel art and lo-fi atmosphere into the community space itself.

- **Free and open to anyone** — this is the discovery pipeline. No paywall blocking new people from finding the community.
- **Tier-gated channels for Travelers ($7.77)** — behind-the-scenes, worldbuilding process, writing discussion. The real room.
- **Inner-circle channel for Innkeepers ($21.21)** — the most engaged members, direct access.
- **Roles sync automatically** via Fourthwall's Discord integration.

### Signal — The Back Table at the Inn

- **Innkeepers only ($21.21).** This is not Discord. This lives on their phone.
- **Group dynamic** — not 1:1 conversations with Evan. Members talk to each other. The crew becomes a crew.
- **What goes here:** late-night paragraph screenshots, real-time thoughts on the work, casual updates, the stuff that's too small for a post but too personal for Discord.
- **Why Signal:** no size caps, end-to-end encrypted, lives on phone for personal notification feel, separate from the Discord community to maintain intimacy distinction.

## Fourthwall Store — Product Lines

One store. Two design lines. Both elevated, no wordmarks, tasteful everything. You won't be embarrassed to have this on your desk.

The **EIW line** reflects the writer's aesthetic — black and white, painterly, literary. The **Outside Inn line** reflects the community atmosphere — warm, pixelated, lo-fi. Two visual languages under one brand. The mismatch between them is known and accepted for v1 — cohesion can evolve over time.

### E.I. Werner Products

| Product | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Gaming Mousepad** | Oversized, branded with EIW design language. For the desk setup. |
| **Classic Mousepad** | Standard size. Clean, elevated. |
| **Deskmat** | Full-desk coverage. The centerpiece of the setup. |
| **Poster (unframed)** | Art prints — fantasy world imagery, brand iconography. |
| **Poster (framed)** | Same designs, premium framed option for the wall. |

### Outside Inn Products

| Product | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Gaming Mousepad** | Outside Inn aesthetic — the inn, the warmth, the lo-fi vibe. |
| **Classic Mousepad** | Standard size. Outside Inn branding. |
| **Deskmat** | Full-desk. The inn on your desk. |
| **Poster (unframed)** | Inn art, animation stills, lo-fi atmosphere. |
| **Poster (framed)** | Same designs, premium framed option. |

### Store Principles

- **No wordmarks.** If the design needs a word on it to make sense, the design isn't good enough.
- **Elevated everything.** The audience includes people who've outgrown most creator merch. This has to be something they'd buy even if they didn't know the brand.
- **Member discounts auto-apply at checkout.** Travelers get 7%. Innkeepers get 14%. The sevens are in the details.
- **Exclusive Innkeeper drops** are separate from the main store — limited runs, announced in the Signal group first.
