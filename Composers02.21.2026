## Tier 1 — Primary Candidates (fully profiled by at least one source)

---

### 1. Solas Composer / Medieval Lofi
**Found by:** Claude  
**Location:** Melbourne, Australia  
**Fantasy** ✅✅ | **Productivity** ✅ | **LoFi** ✅  
**Portfolio:** SoundCloud (soundcloud.com/solas_composer) · Bandcamp (medievallofi.bandcamp.com) · YouTube @MedievalLofi · Spotify (~43K listeners) · Ko-Fi (ko-fi.com/medievallofi)  
**Key tracks:** "Inn of Good Fortune (Lofi Edition)" · "Lofi Bard" · "The Lands Between (Lofi Edition)" · "From the Ashes (Lofi Edition)"  
**Rate tier:** Low-to-mid · Ko-Fi/Bandcamp model · Indie game mod credits (Dark Souls: Archthrones)  
**Commission-ready:** Yes — game mod commissions, Ko-Fi, Bandcamp sales  
**Gap:** Orchestral work can lean cinematic/epic; needs direction to stay intimate  
**Notes:** Operates under multiple aliases (Solas Composer, Medieval Lofi, Nightingale Lofi, Victorian Lofi). The track "Inn of Good Fortune" is essentially an Outside Inn demo reel. Strongest native overlap with all three pillars.

### 2. Signitunes / Signimusic Label
**Found by:** Claude  
**Location:** Jersey City, NJ  
**Fantasy** ✅✅ | **Productivity** ✅ | **LoFi** ✅✅  
**Portfolio:** Website (signitunes.com/fantasy-lofi) · Label page (signitunes.com/label/signimusic) · Spotify · YouTube @signitunes  
**Contact:** signimusiclabel@gmail.com  
**Key instruments:** Harp, flute, acoustic guitar, dulcimer, ocarina, bells, soft choir, strings  
**Rate tier:** Low-to-mid · Indie label building the genre  
**Commission-ready:** Yes — label infrastructure, licensing inquiries via email  
**Gap:** Story-driven worldbuilding could tip tracks toward being too engaging vs. background productivity  
**Notes:** Has formally *defined* "Fantasy Lo-Fi" as a subgenre with compositional theory on their website. Mirrors the OI brief almost word-for-word. Would likely view an OI album as a flagship project.

### 3. Ivan Duch
**Found by:** Claude  
**Location:** Not specified (Fiverr-based)  
**Fantasy** ✅✅✅ | **Productivity** ⚠️ | **LoFi** ⚠️  
**Portfolio:** Fiverr (fiverr.com/ivanduch) · Website (ivanduch.com) · Spotify (~34.5K listeners) · Bandcamp · YouTube · Patreon  
**Key instruments:** Tagelharpa (medieval bowed strings), vocals, standard acoustic instruments  
**Rate tier:** Budget-to-mid · Fiverr starting at $25/gig, per-minute pricing · 22 years experience  
**Commission-ready:** Yes — Fiverr is his commission platform, also Patreon tiers  
**Gap:** Two gaps — production is clean (not natively LoFi), and music leans atmospheric/ambient rather than forward-driving. Both addressable through direction or post-production.  
**Notes:** Strongest value proposition and lowest risk for a paid trial. Real instrument performances (especially tagelharpa) are unique. LoFi gap is additive — can be solved in post.

### 4. Nick Hewitt / Of Sleeping Bears
**Found by:** GPT  
**Location:** Michigan, USA  
**Fantasy** ✅✅ | **Productivity** ✅ | **LoFi** ⚠️  
**Portfolio:** Bandcamp (ofsleepingbears.bandcamp.com) · Bluesky (@ofsleepingbears.bsky.social)  
**Key credits:** Soundtracks for *We Deal In Lead* and *Runecairn* (TTRPG/indie game)  
**Rate tier:** Mid · Actively soliciting 2026 soundtrack commissions  
**Commission-ready:** Yes — seeking commissions now  
**Gap:** LoFi production aesthetic not confirmed as a native skill; multi-instrumentalist but production may lean clean/cinematic  
**Notes:** Self-described "Forever GM" — understands music as backdrop for focus and interaction. TTRPG worldbuilding expertise is a direct fit. The 2026 commission timing is ideal for the March launch window. GPT's top pick.

### 5. Tommy Norris / theboxmonkey
**Found by:** GPT  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Fantasy** ✅✅ | **Productivity** ✅ | **LoFi** ⚠️  
**Portfolio:** Website (tommynorrismusic.com/portfolio) · Active on r/gameDevClassifieds  
**Key skills:** Acoustic/folk instruments, orchestral scoring, Wwise/FMOD (game audio middleware), 7+ years experience, full recording/mixing/mastering  
**Rate tier:** Mid  
**Commission-ready:** Yes — freelance game music composer, active in hiring communities  
**Gap:** LoFi aesthetic not confirmed as native; middleware skills suggest clean game audio production  
**Notes:** Wwise/FMOD proficiency means he can deliver natural-sounding loops without repetitive fatigue — valuable for a 24/7 station. Self-markets as "Folk/Fantasy Music Composer."

### 6. Lowe's Retreat
**Found by:** Gemini  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Fantasy** ✅ | **Productivity** ✅ | **LoFi** ✅  
**Portfolio:** Bandcamp · Streaming platforms · Credits on Lunora Records compilations  
**Key tracks:** "Road to the Green Glass Inn" · "We begin at dawn" (Lunora tavern compilation)  
**Rate tier:** Mid (inferred from platform footprint)  
**Commission-ready:** Probable — independent composer/producer, contactable via Bandcamp  
**Gap:** Broader tagging includes hip-hop/rap categories; need to confirm percussion language isn't trap-driven  
**Notes:** Gemini's top pick. Track naming ("Road to the Green Glass Inn," "We begin at dawn") almost accidentally mirrors Outside Inn's threshold/liminal brand language. Describes own music as "soundtracks to various scenes" — the "writing by candlelight" energy. Two-guitar conversational arrangements signal real authorship.

### 7. Ornella Corradengo
**Found by:** Gemini  
**Location:** Italy  
**Fantasy** ✅ | **Productivity** ✅ | **LoFi** ✅  
**Portfolio:** Instagram · Freelancer.com (orchestral composition) · Lunora Records compilation credits  
**Contact:** Via Freelancer.com profile  
**Key track:** "Harp of Moss and Moon" (Lunora tavern compilation)  
**Rate tier:** Budget-to-mid · Freelancer.com rate listed at $25/hour  
**Commission-ready:** Yes — actively advertising composition services on Freelancer.com  
**Gap:** Appears on a "Celtic LoFi Compilation" — needs steering away from Celtic pastiche toward inn warmth. May default to cinematic grandeur if not briefed for intimacy.  
**Notes:** Rare combination of formal composer identity + LoFi production + active freelance presence. Budget-friendly. "Harp of Moss and Moon" is exactly the right kind of fantasy feeling without genre cosplay.

### 8. Luke Tidbury
**Found by:** Gemini  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Fantasy** ✅✅ | **Productivity** ✅ | **LoFi** ✅  
**Portfolio:** Bandcamp · Streaming platforms · Lunora Records compilation credits  
**Key releases:** *tales from fortrose (Chapter I)* — "atmospheric and moody medieval chill album" · "Druids Rest" (with johto, on Lunora compilation)  
**Rate tier:** Mid (inferred)  
**Commission-ready:** Probable — independent releases, active socials  
**Gap:** Album describes itself as "feudal inspired" — risk of Renaissance faire drift. Needs guardrails on period-specific clichés.  
**Notes:** Has at least one release positioned as acoustic LoFi ("a serene acoustic lofi piece"), strong proxy for organic instrumentation. Track names like "tavern tales," "fortress in the forest," "the round table" are stone-and-candle coordinates.

### 9. Cosmic Koala / Jesus Mares
**Found by:** GPT  
**Location:** Tlalpan, Mexico  
**Fantasy** ✅ | **Productivity** ✅ | **LoFi** ✅  
**Portfolio:** International label credits · Extensive collaboration catalog  
**Contact:** jesusmares82@gmail.com  
**Key tracks:** "Forest Walk" · "Late Night Drive"  
**Rate tier:** Budget-to-mid (inferred from location and market positioning)  
**Commission-ready:** Yes — direct email contact, international label experience  
**Gap:** GPT itself flags a Celtic proximity risk. Catalog includes "Celtic Samurai" and "Globetrotting Music" aesthetics — would need careful steering.  
**Notes:** Strength is "ethereal ambient cues" and "gentle acoustic guitar instrumentals" leaning modern/serene rather than historical.

## Tier 2 — Honorable Mentions & Scouting Leads

| # | Name | Found by | Key Signal | Gap / Risk | Where to Find |
|---|------|----------|------------|------------|---------------|
| 10 | **Fiddlewold** | Claude | 138.5K Spotify listeners, tavern EPs, organic instruments | Clean production (not natively LoFi); may be pricing toward premium | Spotify, Bandcamp |
| 11 | **Invadable Harmony** | Claude | 23+ Bandcamp releases, dark academia piano/strings, candlelight energy | Clean recording; would need LoFi post-processing | Bandcamp (Portugal) |
| 12 | **Daydreaming of Persephone** (Dominik Uskrt) | Claude | Already runs a 24/7 medieval fantasy tavern music stream on YouTube | Essentially a competitor concept; rights negotiation may be complex | YouTube, Ko-Fi |
| 13 | **cembra** | Gemini | Track "Hearthlight" on Tavern Lofi compilation | Unvetted — needs full portfolio review | Tavern Lofi roster |
| 14 | **Tangent Moon** | Gemini | Track "Resting by the Fire" on Tavern Lofi compilation | Unvetted | Tavern Lofi roster |
| 15 | **Lazy Pug** | Gemini | Tracks "King's Landing," "At The Edge of the Castle" | Unvetted | Tavern Lofi roster |
| 16 | **Dizzy Boy** | Gemini | Multiple fantasy tracks: "Moria," "A Brave Tale," "The Eternal Realm" | Unvetted — but consistent fantasy output is a good sign | Tavern Lofi roster |
| 17 | **Elen Hope Music** | Gemini | "The Legend of Avalon" | Celtic pastiche risk flagged by Gemini | Tavern Lofi roster |

## Reference Artist (Not a Hire Candidate)

**Fugee / Chaim Elmalech** — 406K Spotify listeners, releases via Lofi Girl and Jazz Hop Café. GPT profiled him as a direct outreach candidate (fugeemusic@gmail.com), but with that listener count and label backing, he almost certainly prices above the OI range and may not accept WFH terms. Better used as a reference point when briefing other composers: *"We want this energy at this scale."*
