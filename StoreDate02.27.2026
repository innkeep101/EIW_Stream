## Notion Database Schema

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | Title (text) | Freeform — give each product a name with flavor and personality. Not a rigid formula. The name should be scannable on its own (include product type), but the voice is yours. E.g. "Goose I, Cork Coaster" or "Geese, 10×10 Framed" — or something weirder if the mood strikes. |
| **Type** | Single select | `Product` or `Bundle` |
| **Collection** | Single select | Parent grouping: `Goose`, `There I`, `There II`, `Outside Inn` (expand as needed) |
| **Product** | Single select | Physical SKU type: `Cork Coaster`, `Poster`, `Framed Poster`, `Mouse Pad`, `Gaming Mouse Pad`, `Desk Mat` |
| **Dimensions** | Single select | Size where applicable: `10×10`, `18×24`, or blank for standard-sized items (coasters, mouse pads, desk mats) |
| **Cost** | Number (USD) | Fourthwall production COGS (visible in their product designer when uploading art) |
| **Price** | Number (USD) | Retail price — set by us, must be divisible by $0.07 (septimal pricing) |
| **Margin** | Formula | `(Price - Cost) / Price` as percentage. Blank if Cost is empty. |
| **Artist** | Single select | Royalty recipient: `Luiz`, `Marwan` (expand as needed) |
| **File** | Files & media | High-res source artwork image |

**Default view:** Table, grouped by Collection, sorted by Type (Product first, then Bundle).

## Pricing Rules

All prices must be divisible by **$0.07** — rooted in the ONCE mythology's septimal (base-7) numeral system. This is brand DNA, not decoration.

Membership discounts: Scriveners get 7% off merch. Keepers get 14% off.

Royalty: **$0.77/unit** on all merch featuring a collaborator's artwork. Paid to the artist in the Artist field.

---

## Bundle Strategy

Bundles use Fourthwall's native bundle feature. Priced as **buy 3, get 4th free** — bundle price = 3× the unit price of the included product. Bundle prices must also be $0.07-divisible (which they naturally are when the unit price is).

Bundles appear as a single line item at checkout. Fourthwall handles prorated refunds automatically. If any item in a bundle goes out of stock, the entire bundle goes OOS.

Bundles cannot contain other bundles. Not yet available on YouTube/FB/IG/TikTok shop integrations.

## Fourthwall COGS Reference

Estimated production costs from Fourthwall catalog research (Feb 27, 2026). These are what Fourthwall charges per unit — includes production and fulfillment. **Confirm exact costs in the Fourthwall product designer when uploading art.**

Additionally, every transaction incurs a **2.9% + $0.30 payment processing fee** (same as Shopify).

| Product | FW COGS (Est.) | Confidence | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cork Coaster | $5.44 | ✅ Confirmed | Fourthwall catalog listing |
| Classic Mouse Pad (8.7"×7.1") | ~$7.50 | ⚠️ Estimate | Comparable sublimation products |
| Poster (matte, unframed) | ~$7–10.50 | ⚠️ Estimate | PDF says "starts at $7", scales with size |
| Gaming Mouse Pad (18"×16") | $10.50 | ✅ Confirmed | Fourthwall pricing PDF |
| Framed Poster (10×10) | ~$20.35 | ⚠️ Estimate | PDF says "starts at $18.50", 10×10 is small format |
| Desk Mat (15.5"×31.5") | $14.95 | ✅ Confirmed | Fourthwall catalog listing |
| Framed Poster (18×24) | ~$38.00 | ⚠️ Low confidence | Extrapolated from size scaling, could be $35–42 |

## Planned Collections (Not Yet Built)

These collections are referenced in the brand bible but have no inventory records yet.

**There I** — Aspirational landscape frames from Luiz's full illustration. Multiple products at standard pricing.

**There II** — Second set of frames, different crops from the same illustration.

**Outside Inn** — TBD. Likely to include artwork from Marwan (pixel art, animation stills).

**Prelaunch Exclusives** — Select items available only during prelaunch. Gone permanently after. Scarcity is real, not manufactured.

## Fourthwall Operational Notes

**Collections** = curated product groups by theme. Each gets its own URL/page. Must be manually added to homepage via Featured Collection or Collection List sections — they don't auto-display. Can be time-limited (start/end dates) for exclusives.

**Bundles** = multiple existing products sold as one line item at checkout. Pricing options: fixed price, percentage discount off combined value, or keep individual pricing. System prorates pricing across items for taxes/refunds. Cannot contain other bundles. If any item goes OOS, entire bundle goes OOS. Not yet available on YouTube/FB/IG/TikTok shop integrations.

**Payment processing:** 2.9% + $0.30 per US credit card transaction. Varies for PayPal and other providers.

**No monthly fees. No upfront costs. No platform percentage on physical products.** Fourthwall's margin is built into the COGS.

---

## Product Expansion Playbook

When adding new products or collections:

1. Every physical item is **Type: Product**. Every multi-product package is **Type: Bundle**.
2. Bundle pricing = 3× unit price (buy 3 get 4th free). Must be $0.07-divisible.
3. All prices must be divisible by **$0.07**.
4. **Artist** determines royalty recipient ($0.77/unit).
5. **Name** is freeform — make it scannable (include product type) but give it personality.
6. Confirm COGS in Fourthwall product designer before finalizing Cost field.
7. A single illustration can generate multiple collections and dozens of SKUs through different crops and product types. Start narrow, expand based on demand.
