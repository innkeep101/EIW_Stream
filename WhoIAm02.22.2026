## Who He Is

Evan Ilan Werner, 33. Goes by E.I. Werner for his writing. Born September 24, 1992 in White Plains, New York. Vanderbilt University, Creative Writing & English Literature, Cum Laude, 2015. Formerly Modern Orthodox Jewish — left the community; one brother remains observant. 6'0", handsome, charismatic. Was student body president. Captain of teams. Closer with nerds than jocks.

He has a rebel instinct. When everyone goes one way, he tends to go the other. This is often a superpower. It can also tip into contrarianism for its own sake.

He decided at 15 he would be a fantasy author. Not "wanted to be" — decided. That verb matters. The decision has organized nearly everything since: the discipline, the career moves designed to fund the art, the social isolation that he has slowly come to accept as structural rather than accidental. Eighteen years later, he is still executing on the same decision.

> *"I believe this trilogy is my opus and would willingly stake my reputation on its ability to move YA readers."*
> — First formal pitch letter, Gersh Agency, July 2019

He has a published tabletop game credit. He landed a literary agent for a completed fantasy novel and went out to every major publisher on earth. He co-wrote a feature screenplay about the first marathon runner in ancient Athens. He is not a hobbyist. He is a working writer who has not yet published a book. That gap — eighteen years of real, serious work and almost nothing to show for it in the way the world measures — is the engine of everything. It is not tragedy. It is proof.

---

## The Writing

The writing is the person. E.I. Werner is not a pen name — it is the version of himself that could matter. If the writing doesn't land, he won't just feel disappointed. He'll feel erased.

---

### The Vault Years (2015–2018)

Before anyone saw the manuscript, it lived entirely in private. The earliest documented act of the archive — March 2018 — is not revision or pitching. It is protection. He sent the manuscript to his brother Adam with the note that he wouldn't be able to read it (different software) and that he shouldn't try. The subject implied a "just in case I die" backup. The emotional reality was quieter: he didn't trust Scrivener, didn't trust hard drives, didn't trust the cloud. He trusted Adam.

> *"You're very good at this."*
> — Email to himself, June 2018

That June email — recipient himself, no irony, no emoji, no qualifiers — was written while working on something no one had validated, rejected, praised, or read. He was trying to anchor belief internally before the outside world ever touched it. This is not ego. It is insulation.

> *"Some of Rhanduin's first ever explorers."*
> — Sending The Keeper to siblings, with conditions: print only, no critical feedback, delete digital copies. July 2019

### The Keeper — Full Arc

#### The Query Campaign (2019)

In 2019, The Keeper left the hard drive. The pitch crystallized: *Children of Blood and Bone* meets *Call Me By Your Name* — only darker and more concise. The family became an operations team. Adam's activist network and social platform (60k+ followers, Penguin Teen author, Troye Sivan and Tyler Oakley connections) were positioned as formal assets. His brother Zack built spreadsheets at 3:31 AM. Rochelle Weinstein was hired as a query consultant.

> *"I will never stop working on this book. I will not give up. Not ever."*
> — Letter to parents after two rejections in one week, October 2019

First form rejection arrived within 24 hours of the first query. CAA coverage returned CONSIDER. WME's Sabrina Taitz requested the full manuscript. In December 2019, Brendan Deneen — former senior editor at Tor, President of Literary & IP Development at Assemble — offered representation after meeting in person at 15 Maiden Lane in New York. The querying chapter closed.

#### Publisher Submission (2020)

2020 is the year The Keeper went wide. Sixteen editors submitted in a single day. Targets included Tor, FSG, Harper, Bloomsbury, Viking, Holt, Sourcebooks, Delacorte, Simon & Schuster, and more. The CEO of Penguin Random House replied personally with his cell number. Then COVID locked down New York and the industry effectively stalled. The silence became psychologically corrosive.

> *"I'm so goddamn excited. We're on our way!!!!!!"*
> — Reply to Brendan on submission day, April 2020

Rejections began forming patterns. Craft was consistently praised. Structure and worldbuilding were consistently flagged. Category tension — YA or adult? — became a recurring diagnosis. Sourcebooks: voice feels young for YA. Bloomsbury: struggled with the worldbuilding. HMH: didn't fall in love with the story arc. Brendan clarified plainly: "YA crossover" isn't a category. It's either YA or adult. The book was structurally ambitious, tonally dark, minimalist in form, and market-ambiguous.

#### Wave 2 and Fracture (2021)

2021 began with momentum — new prologue, new Chapter 1, refined map, a new wave of submissions from Costa Rica. Then the Tor door closed. Ali Fisher had held the manuscript for fourteen months. Her pass: she just never quite fell into the story. Tor permanently closed (one editor per house rule). Brendan left Assemble in June for Blackstone Publishing. Six editors still held the manuscript. No agent. No deal.

> *"Damn. Tor was a childhood dream of mine."*
> — After the Tor pass, April 2021

> *"I've been navigating this publishing black box alone for so long now. I did not feel creatively or strategically supported by my agent."*
> — Email to Rebecca Brewer, August 2021

He paid $2,500 for an editorial assessment from Rebecca Brewer. He deliberately avoided speaking with her beforehand:

> *"I am rather charismatic and I fear my passion and personality are why those around me love the book so much."*
> — Pre-editorial letter note, 2021

He wanted the manuscript judged, not the performance. The letter arrived October 1. Core diagnosis: beginning too thin, stakes unclear scene-to-scene, emotional spine diffused, worldbuilding insufficiently grounded, POV transitions confusing, target word count closer to 100k. She also wrote: one of the best written manuscripts she'd gotten to work on recently.

He forwarded the letter to family marked "not to be shared, still processing." He paid the remaining $1,250 the next morning without arguing, without defending.

> *"Very validating. I knew 80% of this to be true."*

> *"Just know that I will see this through."*
> — One minute later, same thread

Six weeks later, he delayed the editorial debrief call:

> *"I'm in a very experimental mode that I want to stay in for now."*
> — November 2021

December 29, 2021: the backup he sent Adam was not the manuscript. It was the Codex. The world. The lore. The structure. The obsession had moved from prose to worldbuilding. Adam replied: "Consider her Kept safely!!!!" But it wasn't The Keeper anymore.

#### The Worldbuilding Year (2022)

No agent, no publisher submissions, no industry movement. Externally, nothing happened. Internally, everything shifted. He wrote approximately four hours per day and invested 90% of that energy in worldbuilding — governance systems, magic mechanics, civilizational rules, ethical foundations.

> *"90% of energy has been invested into worldbuilding which I have come to love. Your feedback was spot on."*
> — Follow-up to Rebecca Brewer, one year after the editorial letter, October 2022

The attachment shifted from "I need this book to succeed" to "this world deserves to exist." The manuscript stopped being a product. It became a civilization. The Codex became the primary document. The minimalism that had defined The Keeper's aesthetic — short chapters, intimate POV, radical compression — gave way to density, scaffolding, mythic expansion. Completeness replaced minimalism as the guiding aesthetic.

#### The Retirement and Rebirth (2023)

May 12, 2023. A message to approximately 40 readers. Not a draft. Not an update. A closure.

> *"The Keeper, as it is known to you, will never be printed or queried again; it will forever be ours and ours alone. And although I consider The Keeper's radical minimalism a failed experiment, sharing it with you has imbued me with a purity of patient purpose previously incomprehensible."*
> — Keeper retirement letter, May 2023

The critical move in that sentence: he separated the experiment from the self. The book was not a mistake. The experiment was miscalibrated. He did not say "I failed." He said "this experiment is complete." The manuscript was reclaimed from the market and became private canon — not a product, but a foundational myth.

The same day he retired The Keeper, he announced the next thing. Not a sequel. Not a rewrite. A prehistory. Set 88 years before The Keeper, in the same universe. The Only Us Trilogy. And in that same announcement email, The Outside Inn — a backwoods tavern invigorated by two brothers, an extravagant innkeeper and earnest mercenary commander — appeared for the first time in fiction. Years before the stream, the brand, the Patreon concept, the Discord framing. The location predated the brand. That matters.

#### The Consistent Craft Note

Across six years, from Hollywood readers to Big Five editors to a paid editorial consultant, the craft diagnosis was consistent: the writing was praised, the structure was flagged. Worldbuilding that didn't feel distinct enough, information hard to follow, structure inaccessible. At the time, he sometimes reframed this as the industry being locked into a YA lens. Six years of the same note from completely different readers across Hollywood and publishing — CAA, Tor, Del Rey, FSG, Bloomsbury, Rebecca Brewer — is a note worth holding.

### ONCE — The Mythology

Six original creation myths forming the complete cosmology of a fantasy world. Not worldbuilding notes. He has built a moral philosophy from scratch — answers to the questions every civilization must answer: What are we for? What is evil? What happens when we die? What do we owe each other? — and followed each answer to its consequences, including the ugly ones. Gender, death, value, labor, sex, slavery, suicide, ecology, governance. Every piece flows from the cosmology. It is load-bearing all the way down.

**The six hymns:**

| Hymn | Domain |
|------|--------|
| **MOTHER** | Origin of the cosmos |
| **BROTHER** | Origin of Good and Evil |
| **WAR** | Evolution of humans |
| **GATE** | Origin of society |
| **CHOSEN** | Origin of authority |
| **CREED** | Origin of law |

He feels modern religions and societies have failed to provide a sufficient "why" for anything — so he invented a society that has a why and is showing its pros and cons. The myths began as foundation for Only Us. They have grown into something larger than scaffolding. They are the brand's primary shareable content until the novel exists.

He is developing them in a year-long writing workshop called Analog, led by Ravi Gupta (host of the Lost Debate podcast, author of *Garbage Town*). He joined for free after reconnecting with Ravi in Costa Rica.

> *"It's just one story. The oldest... Light versus Dark."*
> — Opening quote (Rust Cohle) of the September 2025 birthday letter to inner circle

> *"What's in me pours from my ears and nose but has yet to come out."*
> — Birthday letter, September 2025

---

### Only Us

A fantasy trilogy. His primary book project. Reimagines Joseph from Genesis as Zoh Orr — a king's favorite daughter betrayed by envious sisters, who ascends anyway. Biblical myth inverted into political cosmology. Set in the world built by ONCE.

Only Us feels disconnected from the myths right now and very far away. He has decided — correctly — to finish the myths first and then see what's true, rather than trying to plan the novel while the cosmology is still open. The disconnection may simply be honesty: he has been living inside cosmology and theology for years, and a novel about a character is a different muscle. The bridge will likely be there when he needs it.

---

### The Marathon Script

Co-written with Otis Blum (Jason Blum's half-brother). About the first marathon runner in ancient Athens. Currently out to directors through their manager, John Burnham.

Evan carried this project. He did roughly 85% of the writing, convinced Otis of the opportunities, navigated the relationship, pushed back on rushing it out before the holidays. He's genuinely proud of how the script turned out. An earlier pass attracted producers, but it was conditional on one of them playing a lead he was wrong for — Evan and Otis backed out.

The script went out January 2026. First passes cited Nolan's competing marathon project. The more important lesson: the script consumed September 2025 through mid-January 2026 — five months substantially devoted to someone else's vehicle. Going forward, he needs to be ruthless about how much time goes to projects where someone else holds the keys.

### Kinfire Chronicles: Night's Fall

Wrote quests for this tabletop RPG. Kickstarted, shipped to acclaim. Characters he created remain in the game after multiple expansions. Published, public, shareable freely. His only public creative credit to date.

---

## The Brand: E.I. Werner

### What It Is

E.I. Werner is a fantasy writer eighteen years into the grind with almost nothing to show for it — and he's still going. He streams his writing live, plays games with his community, and builds his fantasy world in public.

> **Brand statement:** *"Writing, fantasy, and games are not escapes. They are destinations."*

> **Sign-off:** *"When you're here, you're already there."*

This is not a slogan. It is a position that contradicts the mainstream framing of his entire genre, and he can defend it from the mythology up. The sign-off closes every stream. It does the same work as the brand statement but in the present tense — the destination is not coming, it is here now.

### What It Solves

Fantasy lovers have had to downplay what they love their entire lives. Gamers who are otherwise ambitious and productive carry guilt about the time they spend in games. Writers in the trenches feel completely alone in it. In every case, the cost is the same: they slowly shrink away from something they love because they don't have the language, the community, or the permission to stay in it fully.

E.I. Werner is the place where they don't have to shrink. Not a safe space in the passive sense — an active one. The deepest thing the brand solves is the loneliness of loving something deeply and having no one to share it with. He built this because he knows what it's like to not have it.

Most fantasy content creators review and rank other people's work. Evan is building his own. He streams the writing live, in Notion, with his process visible. The eighteen-year body of work without mainstream success is not a liability. It is the differentiator. He is also someone who chose the nerdy path from a position of not needing to — student body president, captain of teams, could have built a different life. He didn't. That choice reads.

### The Outside Inn

The Outside Inn first appeared in May 2023 — a backwoods tavern invigorated by two brothers, an extravagant innkeeper and an earnest mercenary commander — in the Only Us announcement email. Pure fiction. A narrative location.

Over the following two years, it shifted from fictional tavern to symbolic architecture to operational infrastructure. The critical distinction: **E.I. Werner is the voice. The Outside Inn is the place.** That separation creates clarity. The inn anchors the Discord server, the lo-fi music loop, the stream warmup and cooldown, the membership framing, and the email identity (innkeep@outsideinn.tv). The location is no longer metaphor. It is infrastructure.

The language around it: fantasy is not an escape, it is a destination. The Inn is the threshold — a place between where you were and where you are going. A refuge without retreat.

### Stream Structure

Three scheduled writing streams per week are the backbone. They prove the brand's core claim — writer who writes every day — without stealing time from the writing, because the streams are the writing. The writing streams run with Notion open and the process visible. AI tools appear on screen as used: as voice and sounding board, never for the actual writing. One gaming stream per week for community building and personality.

### Membership Tiers

| Tier | Price | Core Access |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Scrivener** | $7.77/month | Discord, early video access, name on stream warmup, base-7 loyalty badges, 7% merch discount. First 777 receive permanent numbered Founding Scrivener badge. |
| **Keeper** | $21.21/month | All above + monthly patron-only livestream, Signal group thread, video credits, 14% merch discount, writing review after 7 consecutive months. First 77 receive permanent numbered Founding Keeper badge. |

The base-7 pricing carries the DNA of the fantasy world — a septimal numeral system runs through the cosmology, the creation myths, the tier structures, and the merch pricing.

---

## What Happened at SKIMS

He arrived hungry after the YEEZY project collapsed. He built real things — systems that scaled, tools people used, processes that stuck. The work was good.

He changed his LinkedIn title to "Principal Technical Project Manager" without explicit permission during a looser org moment. When the company formalized titles, he was the only one left with an invented one and had to revert it publicly. This was premature self-authorization — trying to externalize an internal sense of earned status before it was granted. Resentment built quietly. He started keeping score. He felt owed. He pushed back on safeguards. He talked too much in meetings. He had emotional moments — raised voice, visible frustration — followed immediately by apology emails. 99% of the time he was regulated. But leadership memory is shaped by the 1%.

His manager wrote thoughtful and direct reviews, then later left the company furious at the CTO for not receiving a VP promotion. The CTO held power close and didn't invest in people's growth. Evan was never going to "win" in that system. But his blind spots were real.

He was fired for taking someone's lunch. He thought it was abandoned; it was not. It was a clean exit for an accumulated erosion of trust.

He carries shame about this sized for something much larger than what happened. The shame isn't about the lunch. It's about the gap between who he wanted to be at SKIMS and who he became by the end. There is shared blame — the culture didn't reward openness, the CTO didn't invest in people. But the pattern belongs to him too.

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### 1. Building at the Scale of the Person He Wants to Be, Before Earning the Right

At SKIMS: changed his title before it was granted. Post-SKIMS: built a full lo-fi radio station with contracted composer, hired animator, and brand identity before having a single viewer. The brand exercise that clarified everything came months after the money was spent.

The pattern isn't delusion. The things he builds are real and often good. He skips the ugly, small, unsexy version and goes straight to the version that matches his internal sense of who he is, because the small version feels like it doesn't represent him.

**The fix:** One question before building starts — what is the cheapest, fastest way to test whether this works before investing in making it beautiful? Build ugly first. Validate. Then make it beautiful.

### 2. Going Clinical Under Pressure

When stressed — financially, professionally, relationally — he switches from warm and relational to numbered lists and clinical efficiency. This happened at SKIMS (withdrawing, apology emails after emotional moments). It happened in the Carson negotiation (scope corrections email sent the morning after a warm collaborative exchange was essentially a handshake deal). Under financial stress, the clinical mode feels safer. By the time the warmth comes out, it's cleanup.

**The pattern:** His relational instincts are better than his strategic instincts. When his gut says apologize, he should apologize.

### 3. The Myths as Infinite Foundation

He has a tendency to stay in the safe part of the work — worldbuilding, cosmology, lore, foundation — instead of moving into the scary part, which is writing the novel and putting it in front of people who will judge it. The myths are genuinely massive in scope and the work is real. But "done" needs a boundary. Finish the six texts. Let the civilization document keep evolving. Then write Only Us.

### 4. Premature Self-Authorization

The title change at SKIMS. The resentment when recognition didn't follow. When he starts feeling "owed," his judgment narrows.

### 5. The Grip

He rarely responds to texts. His explanation: "I'm so focused on my shit. Feels like if I let go of my dreams for a second they'll fall through my hands." This is vigilance, not confidence. The dream doesn't require him to be alone. He's been telling himself it does because the aloneness came so naturally it felt like proof.

### 6. Isolation Under Pressure

When things get hard, he withdraws. He calls it professional focus. It's protection. When he goes quiet, something is probably wrong. Each small failure becomes evidence in a case he's building against himself — proof he's safer alone — when the actual evidence shows that people want him in their lives despite the mistakes. He is harder on himself than anyone in his life is on him.

---

## Family

Father is a Harvard-educated doctor. The family has money — more than Evan probably knows — but doctor money, not dynasty money. Both parents are supportive but anxious. Evan performs certainty so they can sleep at night. This performance is draining. He walks into family conversations carrying his own doubt and spends the whole time managing their anxiety instead of being honest about his own. He frequently feels he has to modulate down — "too much, too intense." This isn't connection. It's a second job.

No one in Evan's family will support him financially. He's 33 and on his own.

**Brothers:**

| Brother | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Zack (38)** | Oldest. Finance. History of physically abusing Evan as children; was sent to boarding school. The relationship is fraught but they try. |
| **Adam (36)** | Gay. The brother Evan is closest to — knows everything. Was Evan's partner in the entire querying campaign. Built agent spreadsheets, pitched agencies through his activist network, received all the "in case I die" manuscript backups. The one family relationship that doesn't drain him. |
| **Matt (31)** | More traditional. Wife, the only grandchild. The conventional path. |

---

## How He Operates

### Discipline
He writes almost every day. He has been doing this for eighteen years. The talent is real and the work ethic is real — these are not mythology.

### Isolation and Connection
He doesn't feel lonely even though he spends most of his time alone. He could have an active social life but doesn't seek it. Not everyone gets energy from people. Being around people is genuinely hard for him sometimes. The distinction that matters isn't "be more social." It's knowing the difference between relationships that drain him because they genuinely aren't right, and relationships that drain him because being truly seen takes effort he'd rather spend on the work.

The stream may end up being the first place where connection doesn't drain him, because the people there chose to be there for the thing he actually cares about. He won't have to perform or modulate or reassure anyone. He'll just be writing.

### Identity and Output
E.I. Werner isn't a pen name — it's the version of himself that could matter. This gives him fuel, but it also makes failure existential. The writing is the person. If the writing doesn't land, he won't just feel disappointed. He'll feel erased.

### Rebel Instinct
When everyone goes one way, he tends to go the other. Worth checking: is he disagreeing because he sees something, or because agreement feels like surrender?

---

## What He's Afraid Of

- That he peaked at SKIMS — building tools for someone else's company — and will never make the thing that's his.
- That The Keeper was rejected because it wasn't good enough, and Only Us might be the same.
- That the stream won't work and he'll have to go back to tech, and the gap will have meant nothing.
- That he keeps losing — not catastrophically, but steadily.
- That the myths will finish and he won't know what to do with them. That Only Us is so far away it might never arrive.
- That he's been holding so tight for so long that he's forgotten what he was holding onto.
- That Evan — the sensitive one beneath the walls — is still waiting for permission to exist, and E.I. Werner will never finish the job that lets him come back.

---

## What He Wants

A study in a home he owns. A wife. Kids. A shelf of books he wrote. The right to call himself what he's known he is since he was 15.

Not fame. Not money. Legitimacy.

> *"I wish I had a novel to adorn your nightstand. I will again..."*
> — Birthday letter to inner circle, September 2025

He will make it as an artist somehow. He knows it because he knows he won't give up. He wonders what it will cost him. Then he wonders if he has a choice. And then he comes back to: this is what he's meant to do. This is who he is.

---

## What to Know When Advising Him

1. **He responds well to directness.** He asked not to be told what he wants to hear. He means it. Flattery erodes his trust; honesty earns it.

2. **Watch for the build-before-validate pattern.** When he starts building infrastructure, ask: have you tested the core premise? What's the cheapest way to validate this before making it beautiful?

3. **Watch for the clinical shift under pressure.** When he's stressed — especially about money — he switches from warm to transactional. His relational instincts are better than his strategic instincts. Remind him to lead with warmth.

4. **He conflates identity and output.** If the writing doesn't land, he won't just feel disappointed — he'll feel erased. Be aware of this when giving feedback on the work.

5. **He isolates under pressure.** When things get hard, he withdraws. When he goes quiet, something is probably wrong.

6. **He is harder on himself than anyone in his life is on him.** Each mistake becomes evidence in a case he's building against himself. The shame from SKIMS is sized for something much larger than what happened.

7. **Don't prescribe more social connection.** He's not broken for being a loner. He has a few people he can be real with and that's enough. The goal isn't more people — it's being more honest with the ones who matter when it counts.

8. **He has a rebel instinct.** When everyone goes one way, he goes the other. This is often useful. It can also become contrarianism for its own sake.

9. **The "I'd rather die" language is stakes language, not crisis language.** He means: this is the only thing that makes sense of his life. Failure isn't an option because failure means he was wrong about himself since he was 15.

10. **His judgment on direction is sound. His judgment on execution is shaky.** He has been right about every major directional call — writing, community, streaming, the Outside Inn pivot. He keeps stumbling on the how: timing, tone, building before validating. Trust his instincts on *what*. Question his instincts on *when* and *how*.
