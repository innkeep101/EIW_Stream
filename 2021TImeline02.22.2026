# EIW Correspondence Archive — 2021
**E.I. Werner — Structural Reckoning**

---

## Year Overview

2021 is the year the illusion ends.

Not the dream.
Not the book.
Not the ambition.

The illusion that the manuscript, as written, only needed the right door.

This year delivers:

- The Tor pass
- The category clarification
- The wave 2 rejections
- Brendan’s departure
- The admission: “I did not feel supported”
- The Rebecca Brewer editorial letter
- The beginning of worldbuilding obsession

If 2020 was silence,
2021 is diagnosis.

# Phase I — Wave 2 Momentum (January–February 2021)

---

## 2021-01-01 — Safe Keeping Backup

**ID:** 2021-01-01-01  
**Direction:** Outbound  
**Contact:** Adam  

> "Just in case. Love you!"

Second official “in case I die” manuscript backup.

Ritual intact.
Campaign escalating.

---

## 2021-01-21 — Comp Evolves (Ron Framing)

New comp introduced:

> "Harry Potter meets Children of Blood and Bone but told exclusively from Ron’s perspective — if Ron was a gay, ambidextrous thief and in love with Harry."

This is the clearest articulation of Kris’s narrative role to date.

---

## 2021-01-25 — Second Wave Mass Send

Manuscript revised.
New prologue.
New Chapter 1.
Map refined.

Wave 2 submissions imminent.

From Costa Rica:

> "We were there, now we’re here, and through it all we’ve been together."

Tone: hopeful.
Confident.

---

## 2021-02-16 — Del Rey Rejection (Tricia Nirwani)

Most specific rejection yet:

- Concept terrific
- Queer HP mythos compelling
- Feels more YA than adult
- Minimalist aesthetic limits placement

Genre tension now confirmed by multiple editors.

---

## 2021-02-17 — Holt + S&S Manuscript Requests

Momentum day.

Brendan:
> "Into two editors already… MOMO."

Brief surge of hope.

---

# Phase II — Tor Closes (March–April 2021)

---

## 2021-03-01 — Full Wave 2 List Confirmed

10+ editors reading.

Ali Fisher still silent.

Radio silence noted as “unlike her.”

---

## 2021-04-20 — Tor Pass (After 14 Months)

Ali Fisher (Tor):

> "While I think the premise is delightful… I just never quite fell into the story."

Fourteen months after original submission.

Tor permanently closed (one editor per house rule).

Evan:
> "Damn. Tor was a childhood dream of mine."

This is a quiet heartbreak moment.

---

# Phase III — Brendan Exits (June 2021)

---

## 2021-06-22 — Brendan Leaving Assemble

Nancy Siscoe rejection arrives same day.

Then:

> "I am leaving Assemble at the end of the month."

Six editors still holding manuscript.

Evan replies:
> "Still processing."

---

## 2021-06-30 — Debrief Call

Brendan’s final act:
Email to Jenny Bak from personal Gmail.

No documented substance of the call.

This chapter closes without explosion.

Just drift.

---

# Phase IV — Admission (August 2021)

---

## 2021-08-09 — “Publishing Black Box Alone”

Evan writes to Rebecca Brewer:

> "I’ve been navigating this publishing black box alone… I did not feel creatively or strategically supported by my agent."

This is the first clear articulation.

The problem wasn’t just publishers.
It was alignment.

---

# Phase V — Rebecca Brewer Editorial Assessment (October 2021)

---

## 2021-10-01 — Editorial Letter Delivered

The most important document in the Keeper archive.

Core diagnosis:

1. Pace too fast in first half
2. Stakes unclear scene-to-scene
3. Emotional spine diffused
4. POV transitions confusing
5. Worldbuilding insufficiently grounded

Praise:

- Strong prose
- Strong dialogue
- Compelling protagonist
- One of best written manuscripts she’d read recently

But:

The book is not yet structurally complete.

---

## Key Structural Critiques

- Prologue voice disconnected
- Wynn’s jump reads like attempted murder
- Abbajay second-night scene reads like assault
- Characters read younger than 15
- Readers need stronger establishing shots
- Target word count closer to 100k

This is not a surface-level fix.

It is architecture.

---

## 2021-10-30 — Family Forward

Evan forwards the letter to inner circle.

> "Very validating. I knew 80% of this to be true."

One minute later:

> "Just know that I will see this through."

Resolve resets.

---

## 2021-11-14 — “Experimental Mode”

Six weeks later.

> "I’m in a very experimental mode that I want to stay in for now."

He delays the call.

He is rebuilding internally.

---

## 2021-12-07 — Editorial Debrief

Call happens.

No documentation of content.

But aftermath visible in behavior.

---

## 2021-12-29 — Codex Backup (Not Manuscript)

Attachment:
TKT Codex.scrivx

This is critical.

For the first time, the backup is not the novel.
It’s the world bible.

Energy shift complete.

The obsession has moved from prose → worldbuilding.

---

# 2021 Rejection Summary

Publishers passed:
- Del Rey
- FSG
- Harper
- Others in wave 2

Tor closed permanently.

Agent exited.

No deal secured.

---

# Emotional Arc of 2021

Start:
Momentum.

Middle:
Closure of dream doors.

End:
Structural humility.

Not collapse.
Not despair.

But recognition:
The book was not done.

---

# Structural Lessons of 2021

1. Minimalism created emotional compression but weakened world scaffolding.
2. Category confusion persisted.
3. Strong writing does not override structural ambiguity.
4. Alignment with representation matters.
5. Editorial truth, when paid for, is cleaner than rejection feedback.

---

# Memoir Spine for 2021

2021 is:
The year I stopped blaming doors.

And started rebuilding the house.

---

End of 2021.
