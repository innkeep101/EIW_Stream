# EIW Correspondence Archive — 2020
**E.I. Werner — Publisher Submission Year**

---

## Year Overview

2020 is the year The Keeper goes to publishers.

It is also the year:

- COVID shuts down New York
- The industry slows to a crawl
- Silence becomes psychological
- Publisher rejections begin
- Genre confusion becomes explicit
- The PRH CEO responds personally

If 2019 was exposure,
2020 is endurance.
