# EIW Correspondence Archive — 2020
**E.I. Werner — Publisher Submission Year**

---

## Year Overview

2020 is the year The Keeper goes to publishers.

It is also the year:

- COVID shuts down New York
- The industry slows to a crawl
- Silence becomes psychological
- Publisher rejections begin
- Genre confusion becomes explicit
- The PRH CEO responds personally

If 2019 was exposure,
2020 is endurance.

Publishing industry effectively stalls.

Silence begins.

---

# Phase III — First Rejections (May–June 2020)

---

## 2020-05-20 — Flux Rejection (Cover Letter Only)

First publisher rejection.

Brendan:
> "They passed based on the cover letter. So…fuck ’em."

---

## 2020-06-08 — Wednesday Books Rejection

> "Didn't quite fall in love here."

Still alive elsewhere.

---

## 2020-06-30 — Sourcebooks Rejection

Most substantive feedback so far:

- Kris compelling
- Queer representation strong
- Voice sometimes feels "young for YA"
- High fantasy challenging category

First explicit category tension.

---

## 2020-06-10 — Tor Confusion Moment

Miscommunication about Ali Fisher (Tor).

Brendan:
> "Your check in specifically regarding Tor fucked my wires up."

Professional boundary moment.

Trust recalibrated.

---

## 2020-07-21 — New Manuscript Revision

Evan:

- Revised manuscript
- New trilogy intro

Raises YA crossover question.

- World intriguing
- Emotional depth present
- Structural doubt

---

## 2020-08-26 — YA vs Adult Clarified

> "'YA crossover' isn't a category. It's either YA or adult."

This becomes foundational tension.

---

CEO of Penguin Random House replies.

Includes:
- His cell number

Major validation event.

No deal outcome.

But psychological impact significant.

---

## 2020-09-29 — Bloomsbury Rejection

Claire Stetzer:
> "Struggled with the worldbuilding."

Second major recurring critique.

Rejection taxonomy now clear:

1. Voice young for YA
2. Worldbuilding thin
3. Strong writing
4. Structural imbalance
5. Market difficulty

---

# Phase VI — Silence + Holiday Dead Season (October–December 2020)

---

## 2020-10-19 — Tor Follow-Up

Ali Fisher still silent.

Submission now 6 months old.

Brendan delays 13 days before responding.

---

## 2020-11-30 — "I Haven’t Forgotten You"

---

# 2020 Rejection Log (Publishers)

- Flux (cover letter)
- Wednesday Books
- Sourcebooks
- HMH (Nicole Sclama)
- Bloomsbury (Claire Stetzer)
- Others pending silence

---

# Emotional Arc of 2020

Start:
Momentum and validation.

Middle:
COVID stall.

End:
Category doubt and industry silence.

Not failure.
Not collapse.
Just suspension.

---

# Structural Lessons of 2020

1. Strong prose is not enough.
2. Minimalism creates worldbuilding vulnerability.
3. YA/adult positioning unclear.
4. Market timing matters.
5. Silence is psychologically corrosive.

---

# Memoir Spine for 2020

2020 is:
The year the book went into the machine.

And the machine went dark.

---

End of 2020.

# EIW Correspondence Archive — 2020  
## The Year It Went Wide  

---

## Year Overview

If 2019 was exposure,  
2020 was escalation.

This is the year The Keeper leaves agents and enters publishers.

It is the year:

- The manuscript goes wide.
- The family becomes a strategy team.
- The CEO of Penguin Random House replies.
- COVID freezes the industry.
- The silence grows longer.
- Hope becomes heavier.

2020 is the year you believe it might actually happen.

And the year you learn how slow “happening” is.

---

# Phase I — The Submission Machine Turns On

## January 2020

You begin the year assembling materials.

Pitch paragraphs.
Bio.
Platform positioning.

You introduce Adam formally into the strategy.

Not as brother.

As leverage.

You write:

> “I believe your expertise will help us decipher which of Adam’s connections will be most compelling when pitching The Keeper.”

You are no longer just an author.

You are assembling a campaign.

---

## February 2020 — The Codex

You send Brendan the full trilogy Codex.

You flag three concerns:

1. Is the White Asp/Rajh plot too confusing?
2. Will child rape in the synopsis intimidate publishers?
3. Book 3’s arc still forming — “a lot of my writing happens in the chair.”

You are transparent.
Unfiltered.
Brave.

Brendan responds with light notes.
Formatting.
Tone adjustments.
Remove “raped,” say “abused.”

Nothing structural.

You feel ready.

---

# Phase II — The Inner Circle Mobilizes

## March 31, 2020

You forward Brendan’s submission list to the family.

28 editors.
28 targets.

You write:

> “Do you mind taking a look at your LinkedIn / Instagram to see if we have any direct connections?”

Zack builds a spreadsheet within 20 minutes.

Adam spots FSG.
Offers to activate.

Michael notices:

> “Both early submissions requested manuscripts. Very pleased!”

Your family becomes infrastructure.

You are not alone in this.

---

# Phase III — April 23, 2020  
## It Goes Wide

Brendan sends the email.

16 editors in one day.

Prior early requests:
- Nicole Sclama (HMH)
- Ali Fisher (Tor)

New wave:
- FSG
- Harper
- Bloomsbury
- Viking
- Holt
- Sourcebooks
- Delacorte
- Simon & Schuster
- And more.

You reply:

> “I’m so goddamn excited. We’re on our way!!!!!!”

This is the apex of optimism.

---

# Phase IV — Then the World Stops

Mid-March 2020: COVID.

Editors go remote.
Schools close.
New York locks down.

You write:

> “We're finally here.”

But nothing moves.

Silence stretches.

You ask:

> “Do things seem stalled out as a result of the pandemic? Do you think we are still on a normal timeline?”

Brendan replies:

> “It’s been REALLY quiet (on all fronts).”

You learn a brutal truth:

Even perfect timing can be erased by global events.

---

# Phase V — The First Publisher Rejections

Flux passes.

Sourcebooks passes.

Wednesday passes.

Houghton Mifflin passes.

Bloomsbury passes.

The notes start forming patterns:

- “Didn’t fall in love.”
- “Voice feels young for YA.”
- “Struggled with the worldbuilding.”
- “No clear editorial vision.”

None of them call it bad.

None of them say it’s broken.

But none say yes.

You remain composed.

You reply:

> “No worries at all.”

But you begin asking different questions.

---

# Phase VI — The YA Problem

You write:

> “I’m not certain that The Keeper fits cleanly in YA.”

You name the content:
- Sex.
- Rape.
- Suicidal ideation.

Is it YA?
Is it crossover?
Is it adult?

Brendan answers plainly:

> “‘YA crossover’ isn’t a category. It’s either YA or adult.”

This is the first time the genre tension is named explicitly.

The manuscript is structurally ambitious.
Tonally dark.
Minimalist in form.
Market-ambiguous.

The craft is praised.

The category is unclear.

---

# Phase VII — The Markus Dohle Email

September 17, 2020.

The CEO of Penguin Random House replies.

Personally.

With his cell number.

He writes:

> “Your father (he is great) told me about how passionate you are…”

He explains:
- CEOs do not recommend manuscripts.
- Editors decide.
- But you should expand PRH outreach.
- Follow up with Jenny Bak.
- Keep pushing.

You forward it to Brendan immediately.

You forward it to family.

You feel momentum again.

You write:

> “My agent feels ignited by your counsel.”

For a brief moment, the door feels open.

---

# Phase VIII — The Silence Returns

You follow up with Tor.
With PRH.
With everyone.

Ali Fisher remains silent for months.

Editors hold manuscripts.

COVID continues.

You keep revising.

Shaving pages.

Polishing lines.

Changing “won’t” to “cannot” in mass emails.

Because if you cannot control timing,
you control words.

---

# Phase IX — The Emotional Undercurrent

Throughout the year you write to Dana.
To family.
To cousins.
To friends.

You say:

> “Things are looking up, they really are.”

And also:

> “Funny how rejections still hurt.”

And also:

> “I cannot help but worry for the world.”

You are balancing:

- Global pandemic.
- Submission silence.
- Personal relationships.
- New job.
- Identity.

And still writing.

---

# What 2020 Teaches

1. Going wide does not mean going fast.
2. Praise is not commitment.
3. Market clarity matters as much as prose.
4. Momentum is fragile.
5. Silence is heavier than rejection.

But you do not panic.

You do not pivot.

You do not abandon the book.

You double down.

---

# Structural Shift of 2020

Before 2020:
You were chasing entry.

After 2020:
You are wrestling with category.

Before 2020:
Representation felt like arrival.

After 2020:
Representation feels like navigation.

The Keeper is no longer just a dream.

It is a product inside a system.

And that system moves slowly.

---

# Memoir Spine of 2020

2020 was the year I believed the book would sell.

And the year I learned that belief is not the same as inevitability.

It was the year the industry went quiet.

But I did not.
