## Year Overview

2018 is not a querying year.
It is not a submission year.
It is not a public year.

It is the year of:

- Private manuscript protection

This is the year The Keeper becomes real enough to preserve.

# Memoir Flag

If writing narrative prose later:

2018 = The Year No One Was Watching.

This is important.

Because it proves the work was never built in response to the market.

It existed before the campaign.

End of 2018.
