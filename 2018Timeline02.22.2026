## Year Overview

2018 is not a publishing year.  
It is not a pitching year.  
It is not even a sharing year.

It is the year of preservation.

There are no agents.
No editors.
No readers.
No audience.

Only the manuscript — and the fear that it might disappear.

---

## March 16, 2018  
### “In Case I Die.”

The first recorded act of 2018 is not revision.

It is protection.

You send the manuscript to your brother Adam with a simple note:

> “You won't be able to read it as you don't have the software. Also please dont :)”

It is half joke.  
Half ritual.  
Half superstition.

The subject line and tone imply something dramatic — a backup “in case I die.”  
But the emotional reality is quieter than that.

You are not planning for death.

You are planning against erasure.

You don’t trust Scrivener.
You don’t trust hard drives.
You don’t trust the cloud.

You trust Adam.

The book is not yet for reading.

It is for safekeeping.

That distinction matters.

## May 31, 2018  
### “Wrote so well today.”

Two months later, another backup.

This one sent from your Portal work email.

Short.
Bare.
Almost breathless.

> “Wrote so well today.”

That’s it.

No pitch.
No explanation.
No context.

Just the feeling of momentum.

This is what 2018 is:
Writing in private.
Then preserving the proof.

Adam replies 41 minutes later:

> “So glad :) — for no eyes only!”

The book is still a secret between brothers.

The circle is tight.

## June 15, 2018  
### “You’re very good at this.”

The only email not sent to another person is sent to yourself.

Subject line irrelevant.
Recipient: Evan Werner.

Body:

> “You're very good at this.”

There is no irony in it.
No emoji.
No qualifiers.

It is not bravado.

It is self-stabilization.

You are writing something that no one else has validated.
No one has rejected.
No one has praised.
No one has read.

You are trying to anchor belief internally before the outside world ever touches it.

This is not ego.

It is insulation.

## What 2018 Actually Is

From the outside, nothing happens.

No submissions.
No conversations.
No visible progress.

But internally, three foundations are laid:

1. **The manuscript exists in full enough form to require backup.**
2. **The ritual of safeguarding through Adam begins.**
3. **Self-validation becomes necessary.**

There is something important here:

You do not send the manuscript to test it.

You send it to preserve it.

That means you already believe it matters.

---

## The Keeper in 2018

In 2018, The Keeper is:

- Still yours.
- Still untested.
- Still unexposed.
- Still intact.

There are no market anxieties yet.
No “worldbuilding thin.”
No “voice too young.”
No YA vs adult debate.

The book is not a product.

It is a vault.

And you are guarding it.

---

## The Psychological Pattern

The pattern that will repeat for years begins here:

- Write.
- Refine.
- Protect.
- Insulate.
- Believe.
- Do not yet expose.

The audience does not exist.

The industry does not exist.

Failure does not exist.

Only the work does.

---

## What 2018 Doesn’t Know Yet

2018 does not know:

- That 2019 will bring agents.
- That 2020 will bring submission.
- That 2021 will bring diagnosis.
- That 2023 will bring retirement.
- That myth will one day replace manuscript.
- That The Keeper will become scaffolding.

2018 believes the book is the destination.

It does not yet understand it is the foundation.

## Memoir Spine of 2018

2018 was the year I wrote in secret and built a vault around the thing I loved.

I did not ask if it would sell.

I did not ask if it was ready.

I only asked one question:

If everything crashes, will it survive?
