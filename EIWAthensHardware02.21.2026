## Deployment Window

**Athens, Greece** — March 15 – May 15, 2026

Base of operations: Cozy Nomad Perfect Home, Athens (Flatio booking)
- Confirmed internet: **195 Mbps down / 19 Mbps up** (Nomad365-certified)
- Dedicated working space with ergonomic chair
- Air conditioning, washer, full kitchen

---

## Project Goal

E.I. Werner streams live from Athens across two content types:

1. **Writing Streams** — 3x/week. Notion open, AI visible, the actual work happening on screen. Outside Inn lo-fi (Marwan's animation + Carson's music) runs as warmup and cooldown bookends.

2. **Gaming Streams** — 1x/week. Community, personality, connection. World of Warcraft and beyond.

**Platform Strategy:**
- **YouTube** — Primary launch platform. All streams go here first. VODs, clips, the Outside Inn ambient loop when not live.
- **Twitch** — Secondary. Added after the YouTube concept is proven and the workflow is tight. OBS pushes to both simultaneously when ready — no rebuild required.
