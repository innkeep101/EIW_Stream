### Application Details

### Goods & Services — Class 041

- Entertainment in the nature of an ongoing special variety, news, music, or comedy show featuring music broadcast over television, satellite, audio, and video media
- Providing online non-downloadable videos in the field of gaming and writing via streaming
- Providing non-downloadable videos in the field of gaming via streaming transmission services

### ⚠️ Important Note — Owner Filed as Individual, Not LLC

The trademark is registered to **Evan Werner (Individual)**, not Outside Inn Studios, LLC. If you intend for the LLC to own this mark (which is generally recommended for business IP protection), you may want to consult a trademark attorney about assignment to the LLC. This is a common and correctable situation but worth addressing before the mark is examined.

### What Happens Next

1. An examining attorney will be assigned — check TSDR every 3–4 months
2. If there are issues, you'll receive an **Office Action** — you must reply by the deadline
3. If approved, the mark will be published for opposition (30-day window)
4. After opposition period clears, you'll file a **Statement of Use** (since this is a 1(b) intent-to-use filing) — this requires demonstrating actual commercial use

### ⚠️ USPTO Scam Warning

All official communications come from **@uspto.gov email addresses only**. The USPTO never requests fees via email payment links, uses Gmail, or third-party domains. Verify everything at [tsdr.uspto.gov](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/) or call 1-800-786-9199.

**Confirmed scam emails received:**

- Feb 2, 2026 — `usptotrademarkalert@gmail.com` — fake $899 "attestation fee"
- Feb 3, 2026 — `teas@uspto.lawoffice116.us` — fake classification clarification

Both deleted. No payment made. No reply sent.
