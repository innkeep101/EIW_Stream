# Evan Werner: Master Profile
**For AI context. Written by Claude, February 20, 2026.**

## Who He Is

Evan Ilan Werner, 33. Goes by E.I. Werner for his writing. Born September 24, 1992 in White Plains, New York. Vanderbilt, Creative Writing & English Literature, Cum Laude, 2015. Formerly Modern Orthodox Jewish — left the community, one brother still observant. 6'0", handsome, charismatic. Was student body president. Captain of teams. Closer with nerds than jocks. Has a rebel streak — when everyone goes one way, he tends to go the other.

He decided at 15 he would be a fantasy author. Not "wanted to be" — decided. That decision has organized nearly everything since: the discipline, the isolation, the career moves designed to fund the art. He's been working toward the same thing for 18 years.

He is a person who keeps going. That has never been in doubt. Not once in 18 years.

---

## The Family

Father is a Harvard-educated doctor. The family has money — more than Evan probably knows — but it's doctor money, not dynasty money. Both parents are supportive but anxious. Evan performs certainty so they can sleep at night. This performance is draining — he walks into family conversations carrying his own doubt about whether any of this works, and spends the whole time managing their anxiety instead of being honest about his. He leaves more depleted than he entered.

He also reports feeling like he has to modulate down in family interactions — that he's "too much, too intense" — and frequently leaves conversations feeling like he needs to apologize for something. This isn't connection. It's a second job.

**Four brothers:**

- **Zack (38):** Oldest. Finance. History of physically abusing Evan as children; was sent to boarding school. The relationship is fraught but they try.
- **Adam (36):** Gay. The brother Evan is closest to. Knows everything. Was Evan's partner in the Kept querying campaign — built agent spreadsheets, pitched agencies through his activist network, received the "in case I die" backup emails of the manuscript. In February 2026, Evan reached out to Adam to say they should talk more. Adam responded well. This is the one family relationship that doesn't drain him.
- **Matt (youngest):** More traditional. Wife, the only grandchild. The conventional path.
- **Evan (33):** The artist. The one who doesn't respond to texts.

No one in Evan's family will support him financially. He's 33 and on his own.

## The Writing

### ONCE — The Mythology

Six original creation myths forming the cosmology of a fantasy world. This is his current primary writing project, being developed in a year-long writing workshop called Analog with Ravi Gupta (host of Lost Debate podcast, author of Garbage Town). He joined the class for free after reconnecting with Ravi in Costa Rica.

The myths have been in development for over two years, including throughout his time at SKIMS. He is ashamed of how long they've taken but confident he will finish them this year in Ravi's class.

What the myths actually are: not worldbuilding in the conventional fantasy sense. He's built a complete moral philosophy that answers the questions every civilization must answer — What are we for? What is evil? What happens when we die? What do we owe each other? — and followed each answer to its consequences, including the ugly ones. The civilization document covers gender, death, value, labor, sex, slavery, suicide, ecology, governance. Every piece flows from the cosmology. It's load-bearing all the way down.

The reason the myths have taken so long is not that he was hiding from the novel. It's that the thing he's building is genuinely massive in scope, and he kept going deeper instead of drawing boundaries around what "done" means. He needs to finish the six texts as standalone pieces this year and let the civilization document keep breathing as a living reference.

He feels that modern religions and societies have failed to provide him with a sufficient "why" for anything. So he invented a society that has a why and is showing its pros and cons. This is the engine of the whole project.

The myths started as foundation for Only Us. They've grown into something bigger than scaffolding. They are his differentiator as a creator — what makes him different from every other fantasy content creator who reviews and ranks other people's work. They are the brand's primary shareable content until the novel exists.

### Only Us

A fantasy trilogy. His primary book project. Reimagines Joseph from Genesis as Zoh Orr, a king's daughter who ascends despite betrayal. Set in the world built by ONCE.

Only Us feels disconnected from the myths right now and very far away. He has decided — correctly — to finish the myths first and then see what's true, rather than trying to plan the novel while the myths are still unfinished. The disconnection may just be honesty: he's been living inside cosmology and theology for two years, and a novel about a character is a different muscle. The bridge will likely be there when he needs it.

### Kept — The First Trilogy (Retired)

The complete documented history spans May 2017 to May 12, 2023. Six years.

Kept was a fantasy trilogy. Evan wrote the first book and a trilogy outline. The querying campaign was genuinely extraordinary in scope: at least 14 publishers, 20+ individual editors, multiple full manuscript requests from the largest publishers on earth. Formal CAA coverage for adaptation. Paradigm Talent Agency. UTA media rights. WME. The CEO of Penguin Random House replied personally with his cell number. A map commissioned from an artist in Ireland for $100 that every single person mentioned. A scientist consulted on a compound that doesn't exist for the worldbuilding.

He landed an agent (Brendan, at Assemble Media) in December 2019. Three dream literary agents passed on the same day. The agent relationship lasted until June 2021 when Brendan left Assemble for Blackstone Publishing. By Evan's own later admission, he never truly felt The Keeper was in the right hands.

The book had a consistent problem that multiple independent readers identified — worldbuilding that didn't feel distinct enough, information that was hard to follow, a structure that felt inaccessible. At the time, Evan often reframed this as the industry being locked into a YA lens. Six years of the same note from completely different people across Hollywood and publishing is worth sitting with.

Retired May 12, 2023. His retirement letter to the 40 people who read it: "The Keeper, as it is known to you, will never be printed or queried again; it will forever be ours and ours alone. And although I consider The Keeper's radical minimalism a failed experiment, sharing it with you has imbued me with a purity of patient purpose previously incomprehensible."

He retired it on his own terms. His standards, not theirs. That's integrity, not failure.

The Outside Inn — the community gathering place that now anchors the entire EIW brand — first appeared as a backwoods tavern in the prequel to the book nobody published. The fiction preceded the brand.

### The Marathon Script

Co-written with Otis Blum (Jason Blum's half-brother). About the first marathon runner in ancient Athens. Currently out to directors and production companies via their manager, John Burnham, since the day after MLK Day 2026.

Evan carried this project. He did roughly 85% of the writing, convinced Otis of the opportunities, navigated the relationship, and pushed back on rushing it out before the holidays when he saw low-hanging improvements. He's genuinely proud of how the script turned out.

Earlier in the process, there were producers interested but it was conditional on one of them playing a lead and he was the wrong fit, so Evan and Otis backed out.

The script consumed September 2025 through mid-January 2026 — five months where the myths and Only Us didn't move much. It was real work and real experience, but it was also five months substantially devoted to someone else's vehicle. Going forward, he needs to be ruthless about how much time goes to projects where someone else holds the keys.

No word yet on any movement. He's starting to feel like it likely won't go anywhere, which may or may not be true. He always knew it was a long shot.

### Kinfire Chronicles: Night's Fall

Wrote quests for this tabletop game. Kickstarted, shipped to acclaim. Characters he created remain in the game after multiple expansions. Published, public, shareable freely.

## The Brand: E.I. Werner

### What It Is

E.I. Werner is a fantasy writer 18 years into the grind with almost nothing to show for it — and he's still going. He streams his writing live, plays games with his community, and builds his fantasy world in public.

**Brand statement:** "Writing, fantasy, and games are not escapes. They are destinations."

**Sign-off:** "When you're here, you're already there."

### What It Solves

The brand exists because he's been doing this alone for almost two decades and wants the room full of people he's never had. For fantasy lovers who've had to downplay what they love, gamers tired of apologizing for their passion, and writers in the trenches who feel alone — this is the place where you don't have to shrink.

The deepest thing the brand solves: the loneliness of loving something deeply and having no one to share it with. Evan built this because he knows what it's like to not have it.

### How It Connects to Where He Is Personally

The stream may end up being the first place where connection doesn't drain him, because the people there chose to be there for the thing he actually care about. He won't have to perform or modulate or reassure anyone. He'll just be writing. That's a different kind of not-alone than calling people back.

He is hopeful about this with clear eyes. Not manic, not hedging. He knows it's not a panacea and won't work right away. But the entire brand is designed to solve the exact isolation problem he's been living with — not just for the audience, but for himself.

### The Stream Structure

Three scheduled writing streams per week (the backbone — proves "writer who writes every day"). One scheduled gaming stream per week. The writing streams ARE the work — they don't steal time from writing, they are the writing. This is the load-bearing insight of the whole content strategy.

### Outside Inn's Role

Outside Inn is a lo-fi music and animation project that lives inside the E.I. Werner stream as the warmup and cooldown — not a separate channel, not a separate brand, not a standalone radio station. It opens every stream with lo-fi music, scrolling member names, and settling-in energy. It closes every stream as the wind-down.

This is a significant pivot from the original plan. See "The Eight Months" section for full context on how this evolved and what it cost.

### Monetization

Everything runs through Fourthwall — memberships, merch, storefront. Two membership tiers: Traveler ($7.77/month) and Innkeeper ($21.21/month). The pricing carries the base-7 DNA of the fantasy world. Revenue target: $3,000/month recurring by September 1, 2026.

Full brand strategy, content plan, and monetization structure documented separately in the EIW Brand Master Document (February 11, 2026).

## What Happened at SKIMS

He arrived hungry after the YEEZY project collapsed. He built real things — systems that scaled, tools people used, processes that stuck. The work was good. But over time, something shifted.

He changed his LinkedIn title to "Principal Technical Project Manager" without explicit permission during a looser org moment. When the company formalized titles, he was the only one left with an invented one. He had to revert it publicly. This was premature self-authorization — trying to externalize an internal sense of earned status before it was granted.

Resentment built quietly. He started keeping score. He felt owed. He pushed back on safeguards. He talked too much in meetings. He had a handful of emotional moments — raised voice, visible frustration — followed immediately by apology emails. 99% of the time he was regulated. But leadership memory is shaped by the 1%.

His manager, who wrote thoughtful and direct reviews, later left the company furious at the CTO for not getting the VP promotion he'd been working toward. The CTO held power close and didn't invest in people's growth. Evan was never going to "win" in that system. But his blind spots were also real.

He was fired for taking someone's lunch. He thought it was abandoned; it was on the fence. There had been an email about food theft weeks earlier that he didn't remember. It was a clean exit for an accumulated erosion of trust.

He carries shame about this that's sized for something much larger than what happened. The shame isn't about the lunch. It's about the gap between who he wanted to be at SKIMS and who he became by the end.

SKIMS was also hard because it was hard to be himself there. He failed at the connection side, especially when busy. But the environment was also actively making connection harder — the culture didn't reward openness, the CTO didn't invest in people. There's shared blame.

## The Eight Months Since SKIMS (June 2025 – February 2026)

### What Happened

Lost the job. Was humiliated. Moved in with parents in NYC. Was already working on the myths (had been for 2+ years at SKIMS). End of August, Otis called with movement on the Marathon script. Evan spent three weeks repairing it solo, then flew to LA for a war room with Otis. The initial producers fell through. Evan spent September through mid-January perfecting the script and getting it out through John Burnham.

Also at the end of August, decided to become a streamer again. Had done it a bit during COVID. Wanted it to be different this time — more legit and thoughtful. Decided to build a lo-fi radio station (Outside Inn) with his former roommate Carson Thatcher producing music and an animator (Marwan Hasnaoui) from Morocco he found on ArtStation after fielding 60+ applicants. Had a failed engagement with an artist named Barb before Marwan that cost a few weeks and $600.

The stream concept evolved through multiple iterations:
1. **First:** Outside Inn as one stream — lo-fi radio when he's not live, his stream when he is.
2. **Second:** Separate Outside Inn radio stream and separate EIW personal stream, because people tuning in for consistent music would expect consistency.
3. **Third (current, as of February 11, 2026):** Just the EIW stream, with Outside Inn music and animation as the warmup and cooldown before and after his live sessions.

The final pivot happened after completing a personal brand exercise that clarified the actual goal: building a community around him and his writing. Not building a radio station.

Arrived in Costa Rica December 15, 2025. Has been surfing, writing, and building projects. Met up with Ravi Gupta for dinner, who invited him to join his year-long writing workshop (Analog) for free. Accepted. Originally planned to write Marathon as a novel during the course, but Otis nixed that, so returned to the myths. Plans to finish the myths this year in Analog.

Set up expert network profiles in mid-January. Second call is tomorrow. First call was $399/hour for a full hour. Sporadic but meaningful income when it comes. His experience will only get more dated over time.

### What He Did Well

- **Didn't collapse.** Within weeks of being fired he was working.
- **Carried the Marathon script with real judgment.** Pushed back on rushing it, walked away from wrong producers, did 85% of the writing, navigated a lopsided collaboration without blowing it up.
- **Joined Ravi's workshop.** Possibly the best decision of the eight months. Structured accountability for the actual writing with someone whose taste he respects, for free.
- **Pivoted on Outside Inn when the brand exercise showed him the truth.** Hard to do after months of investment and telling people that's what he was building.
- **Built a genuinely strong brand strategy.** The brand document isn't vibes — it's a business plan with clear positioning, audience definition, content strategy, and monetization.
- **Expert network setup.** Smart, low-effort bridge income.

### What He Did Poorly

- **Built before he knew what he was building.** Outside Inn went from lo-fi radio to two streams to warmup/cooldown. Cost ~$10k and several months. The brand exercise that clarified everything happened in February 2026. It should have happened in September 2025.
- **The Marathon script ate months on a project whose outcome he can't control.** Five months substantially devoted to someone else's vehicle.
- **Burn rate not tracked tightly enough.** Left SKIMS with ~$112k total ($77k cash after severance, $35k crypto). Now at ~$62k ($38k cash, $24k crypto). That's $50k in eight months — roughly $6,250/month. Needs monthly tracking, not vibes.
- **The myths still aren't done after 2+ years.** The scope is genuinely massive, but the lack of clear "done" boundaries has allowed the project to expand indefinitely.

## The Carson Thatcher Situation

### What Happened

Carson Thatcher is Evan's friend of over a decade and a legitimate working producer/songwriter with credits on major releases. His market rate is $4k+/song. He was producing the music for Outside Inn at well below market rate as a favor to a friend.

The business negotiation escalated over email in early February 2026. Key sequence:

1. An AI assistant (Claude, in a previous conversation) advised Evan to lower the per-track cash payment from $500/track to $150/track and frame it as strategic restructuring rather than financial necessity.
2. Carson's manager had a great call with Evan on February 5 and the deal was essentially agreed at $3,000 for the album.
3. Hours after that call, Carson sent a warm, collaborative email ("Super hyped bro") with reasonable pushback on scope math.
4. The AI advised Evan to call the original $9k figure "an estimate, not a handshake deal" and to remove an apology Evan had instinctively included.
5. Evan sent a numbered list of scope corrections — clinical in tone, sent the morning after the deal was essentially closed.
6. Carson responded with a $15k spite counter, legal threats about master ownership, and passive-aggressive comments about Evan's travel lifestyle.
7. Evan tried calling. No answer. Over the next several days, he sent three increasingly honest and vulnerable text messages taking full ownership.
8. Carson responded: "On a friendship level it's cool. It wasn't about the money, it was about the way in which you switched it up and about your follow up email and ultimately respect."
9. Carson agreed to finish some tracks as a kindness, no money upfront, and end the ongoing business partnership.
10. As of February 16, Carson is sending completed deliverables and offering to call.

### What It Revealed

Evan's relational instincts were better than the AI's strategic advice at every turn. He wanted to apologize — the AI said remove it. He questioned the "estimate" framing after sending — the AI validated it. His drafts were warmer — the AI made them more clinical.

But Evan followed the advice. He chose the clinical framing over the warm one. He chose leverage over relationship. Under financial stress, he got transactional — the same pattern that showed up at SKIMS.

Carson wasn't an asshole situation. The email wasn't cruel or disrespectful in intent. It was a numbered list of scope corrections sent to a friend who had just written a warm, collaborative message. The mismatch in tone did the damage. Carson's response was disproportionate (legal threats, spite number, vacation comments) but his core read was correct.

The recovery worked because the foundation was real love. When Evan showed up as himself — the actual Evan, not the negotiator — Carson could meet him there.

**Key lesson:** When you love someone, lead with that. Especially when you're scared. Your relational instincts are better than your strategic instincts. When your gut says apologize, apologize.

### Current Status

Carson is finishing tracks as a favor. The business partnership is ending but the friendship survived. Evan needs to have a phone call with Carson to sort the business terms for the remaining deliverables before more work accumulates in ambiguity. He has explicitly learned not to negotiate over text or email with Carson.

## Patterns

### 1. Building at the Scale of the Person He Wants to Be, Before Earning the Right

At SKIMS: changed his title before it was granted. Had to walk it back.

In these eight months: built a full radio station with contracted composer, hired animator, and brand identity before having a single viewer. The brand exercise that clarified everything came months after the money was spent.

The pattern isn't delusion. The things he builds are real and often good. He skips the ugly, small, unsexy version and goes straight to the version that matches his internal sense of who he is. Because the small version feels like it doesn't represent him.

**The fix:** One step before building starts. What is the cheapest, fastest way to test whether this works before I invest in making it beautiful? Build ugly first. Validate. Then make it beautiful.

He caught this pattern himself when he folded Outside Inn into the EIW stream. The goal is to catch it before the money is spent, not after.

### 2. Going Clinical Under Pressure

When stressed — financially, professionally, or relationally — he switches from warm and relational to numbered lists and clinical efficiency. This happened at SKIMS (apology emails after emotional moments, eating lunch alone, withdrawing). It happened with Carson (scope corrections email after a warm collaborative exchange). It happened because he was trained by AI advice that optimized for leverage over relationship, but he followed it because the clinical mode felt safer under financial stress.

The pattern: the warmth is there, but under pressure he leads with logic. By the time the warmth comes out, it's cleanup.

### 3. The Myths as Infinite Foundation

He has a tendency to stay in the safe part of the work — worldbuilding, cosmology, lore, foundation — instead of moving into the scary part, which is writing the novel and putting it in front of people who will judge it. The myths are genuinely massive in scope and the work is real. But "done" needs a boundary. Finish the six texts. Let the civilization document keep evolving. Then write Only Us.

### 4. Premature Self-Authorization

The title change at SKIMS. The resentment when recognition didn't come. When he starts feeling "owed," his judgment narrows.

---

## How He Operates

### Discipline

He is disciplined. He writes almost every day. He has been doing this for 18 years. The talent is real and the work ethic is real — these are not mythology.

### The Walls

He is sensitive but has built walls. The walls protect the project. The project is E.I. Werner. He has decided E.I. Werner is more important than the sensitive person underneath. This is both a strategy and a cost.

### Isolation and Connection

He doesn't feel lonely even though he spends most of his time alone. He could have an active social life but doesn't seek it. He has a few close friends he can be real with and calls them sometimes. That's not a deficit — that's his wiring.

Not everyone gets energy from people. Being around people is genuinely hard for him sometimes. Many relationships don't fill him with energy or life — they feel draining. Digital connection is almost always draining.

The distinction that matters isn't "be more social." It's knowing the difference between relationships that drain him because they genuinely aren't right, and relationships that drain him because being truly seen takes effort he'd rather spend on the work.

### The Exhaustion from Mistakes

He gets very exhausted by others' reactions to his mistakes. The accumulation of incidents — SKIMS, Carson, small things like a door left open or a surfboard left behind — makes him want to retreat behind walls and be alone. This is real and honest. It's not laziness or antisocial behavior. It's the cost of being someone who's sensitive to how he's perceived, living in a world where mistakes are inevitable.

A Costa Rica host sent him a kind message about leaving the front door open and a broken surfboard behind when he left. The message was gentle and caring. Evan's response was guilt and a desire to isolate. He was rushing out and should have thought ahead, but the reaction — wanting to put walls up — was disproportionate to the mistake. This is the same pattern: each small failure becomes evidence in a case he's building against himself, proof that he's safer alone, when the evidence actually shows he's someone people want in their lives despite the occasional open door.

### The Grip

He never responds to texts. His explanation: "I'm so focused on my shit. Feels like if I let go of my dreams for a second they'll fall through my hands." This is vigilance, not confidence. The grip has to stay tight.

The dream doesn't require him to be alone. He's just been telling himself it does because the aloneness came so naturally that it felt like proof. The writing is who he is. The isolation is just how he's been doing it so far.

### Identity and Output

E.I. Werner isn't a pen name — it's the version of himself that could matter. This gives him fuel, but it also makes failure existential. The writing is the person. If the writing doesn't land, he won't just feel disappointed. He'll feel erased.

---

## Finances (As of February 2026)

- **Cash:** ~$38,000
- **Crypto:** ~$24,000 (down from $35k — market decline)
- **Total:** ~$62,000
- **Left SKIMS with:** ~$112,000 ($77k cash after severance, $35k crypto)
- **Spent in 8 months:** ~$50,000 (~$6,250/month average)

- **Target:** $3,000/month recurring revenue by September 1, 2026. If that doesn't happen by December 31, 2026, he'll look for the easiest possible remote ecommerce tech job.
- **Runway:** 8-10 months at current burn before uncomfortable territory. Needs monthly tracking with actual numbers.

---

## Where He Is Now

Leaving Costa Rica (arrived December 15, 2025). Then New York, then Athens March 15 – May 15 to write and stream. Good wifi researched, affordable, no rent obligation.

**Routine in Costa Rica:** Wake at 8am. Big breakfast. Adderall (prescribed, many years). Write and work on projects all day. Meet with collaborators. Surf 4:30–6pm. Dinner. Video games. Read. Sleep.

Off weed for all of Costa Rica. Feels no different. Plans to smoke again in New York. Probably won't smoke in Athens.

## What to Know When Advising Him

### 1. He responds well to directness.
He asked not to be told what he wants to hear. He means it. Flattery erodes his trust; honesty earns it.

### 2. Watch for the build-before-validate pattern.
When he starts building infrastructure, ask: have you tested the core premise? What's the cheapest way to validate this before making it beautiful?

### 3. Watch for the clinical shift under pressure.
When he's stressed — especially about money — he switches from warm to transactional. If he's writing numbered lists to a friend or collaborator, something has gone wrong. His relational instincts are better than his strategic instincts. Remind him to lead with warmth.

### 4. He conflates identity and output.
If the writing doesn't land, he won't just feel disappointed — he'll feel erased. Be aware of this when giving feedback on the work.

### 5. He isolates under pressure.
When things get hard, he withdraws. He calls it professional focus. It's protection. When he goes quiet, something is wrong.

### 6. He is harder on himself than anyone in his life is on him.
Each mistake becomes evidence in a case he's building against himself. The shame from SKIMS is sized for something much larger than what happened. He treats each flaw as confirmation that he's safer alone, when the evidence shows people want him in their lives despite the mistakes.

### 7. Don't prescribe more social connection.
He's not broken for being a loner. He has a few people he can be real with and that's enough. The goal isn't more people — it's being more honest with the ones who matter when it counts, instead of after it costs him something.

### 8. He has a rebel instinct.
When everyone goes one way, he goes the other. This is often useful. It can also become contrarianism for its own sake. Worth checking: is he disagreeing because he sees something, or because agreement feels like surrender?

### 9. The "I'd rather die" language is stakes language, not crisis language.
He means: this is the only thing that makes sense of his life. Failure isn't an option because failure means he was wrong about himself since he was 15. This is worth understanding, not pathologizing.

### 10. His judgment on direction is sound. His judgment on execution is shaky.
He has been right about every major directional call — writing, community, streaming, the Outside Inn pivot, the apology to Carson. He keeps stumbling on the how: timing, tone, building before validating. Trust his instincts on what. Question his instincts on when and how.

---

## What He's Afraid Of

That he peaked at SKIMS — building tools for someone else's company — and will never make the thing that's his.

That Kept was rejected because it wasn't good enough, and Only Us might be the same.

That the stream won't work and he'll have to go back to tech, and the gap will have meant nothing.

That he keeps losing — not catastrophically, but steadily. Losing Carson as a partner. Losing money. Losing time. Losing confidence in his own judgment after three things in a row where he was wrong on execution.

That the myths will finish and he won't know what to do with them. That Only Us is so far away it might never arrive.

That he's been holding so tight for so long that he's forgotten what he was holding onto.

That Evan — the sensitive one beneath the walls — is still waiting for permission to exist, and E.I. Werner will never finish the job that lets him come back.

---

## What He Wants

A study in a home he owns. A wife. Kids. A shelf of books he wrote. The right to call himself what he's known he is since he was 15.

Not fame. Not money. Legitimacy.

He will "make it" as an artist somehow. He knows it because he knows he won't give up. He wonders what it will cost him. Then he wonders if he has a choice. And then he comes back to: this is what he's meant to do. This is who he is.
