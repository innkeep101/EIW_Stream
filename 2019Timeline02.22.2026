# EIW Correspondence Archive — 2019
**E.I. Werner — The Keeper Enters the World**

This is the year of:

---

# Memoir Spine for 2019

2019 is:
The year I let the book leave the house.

It is also:
The year I discovered that praise and rejection can coexist in the same sentence.

---

# EIW Correspondence Archive — 2019  
## The Exposure Year  

---

## Year Overview

2019 is the year The Keeper leaves the hard drive.

It stops being sacred.
It starts being evaluated.

You move from:

- Protection → Pitch  
- Vault → Marketplace  
- Brother → Industry  

The manuscript that only Adam held becomes a file attached to emails with subject lines like:

> QUERY: THE KEEPER (80,000-word Queer Fantasy)

There is no going back after that.

---

# Phase I — The First Send

## July 17, 2019  
### The Siblings

You send The Keeper to Zachary, Matthew, and Julia.

You open with a Holden Caulfield quote.

You give them reading conditions:
- Print only.
- No critical feedback.
- Delete digital copies.

You call them:

> “People who believed me when I told them I was a wizard.”

You sign off:

> “Some of Rhanduin’s first ever explorers.”

This is the first time the world leaves you.

Not to agents.

To blood.

---

## Same Day — Gersh Agency

68 minutes later, you pitch David and Eric Gersh.

You sign:

> E.I. Werner

First documented use of the pen name in a formal pitch.

And you write the most dangerous sentence in the archive:

> “I believe this trilogy is my opus and would willingly stake my reputation on its ability to move YA readers.”

There is no irony in it.

This is not marketing.

It is belief.

They do not respond.

But you’ve crossed a threshold.

---

# Phase II — The Warm Introductions

## WME

Rafi sends the manuscript to Sylvie Rabineau at WME.

She routes it to New York.

You reply:

> “My expectations are 0 but still…”

They do not take it.

But for the first time:
The Keeper touches real machinery.

---

## Vanderbilt Professor

You email Peter Guralnick — Pulitzer-winning author.

He replies kindly.
He cannot help.

You are learning something:

Admiration does not equal advocacy.

---

# Phase III — The Query Campaign

October 2, 2019.

You write:

> “I’ve just tied a ribbon on a shippable draft and have started looking to send it to agents as of this morning.”

The campaign begins.

You build a 40+ agent spreadsheet.
You cross-reference Adam’s network at 3:31 AM.
You hire Rochelle Weinstein to guide your query process.

The tone sharpens.

The pitch crystallizes:

> “Children of Blood and Bone meets Call Me By Your Name — only darker and more concise.”

The Adam Eli P.S. appears:

60k Instagram followers.
Troye Sivan.
Tyler Oakley.
Queer influence as leverage.

You are no longer just writing.
You are packaging.

---

# Phase IV — First Rejections

The first form rejection arrives within 24 hours.

Then another.

Then another.

Some say:
- “Didn’t connect.”
- “Not right fit.”
- “Voice feels young.”

One says:
- “Wonderful writer.”
- “Didn’t emotionally connect.”

One says:
- “Not adding YA.”

And one — Hillary Jacobson, your dream agent — passes without feedback.

That one lands harder.

You respond:

> “I know it’s all going to work out. Just don’t know how or when or how to get agents to read my manuscript haha.”

The “haha” is doing a lot of work.

---

# Phase V — The Brendan Moment

November 21, 2019.

An email arrives:

> “Really enjoying it, definitely interested.”

Brendan Deneen.

Former Senior Editor at Tor.
President of Literary & IP Development at Assemble.

You meet December 3rd at 15 Maiden Lane.

After the meeting, you write:

> “Hugely influential brands hire him as a sensitivity consultant and he has some information that he believes will help you sell / package us.”

You immediately want Adam in the room.

This is not just about representation.
It is about architecture.

---

## December 4, 2019  
### The Offer

You tell Rochelle first.

> “Brendan Deneen has offered to represent THE KEEPER.”

You notify the other agents.

Some step aside immediately.
Some congratulate you.
Some say you’re in good hands.

One writes:

> “You’re already in good hands with Brendan.”

The campaign ends not with fireworks —
but with structure.

---

# Phase VI — The Courtesy Window

The most revealing part of 2019 is not the rejections.

It is the courtesy nudges.

You write multiple agents:

> “You are my dream agent…”

The same line.
To different people.

It is not manipulation.

It is strategy.

But you are learning something quietly:

The dream agent is whoever says yes.

---

# Emotional Spine of 2019

Early 2019:
Belief without friction.

Mid 2019:
Hope meets silence.

Late 2019:
Rejection meets resolve.

December 2019:
Validation arrives — but softly.

You write to Adam after a rejection:

> “Funny how rejections still hurt even when I have representation.”

This is maturity.

Representation does not erase vulnerability.

---

# What 2019 Does Not Know Yet

2019 believes:

- Representation is the hardest step.
- Publishing will now be linear.
- The book will find its home.

It does not yet know:

- 2020 will widen submission.
- 2021 will fracture confidence.
- 2023 will retire the manuscript.
- The myth will outgrow the novel.

2019 still believes the gate has opened.

It does not yet understand how many gates exist.

---

# Structural Shift of 2019

Before 2019:
The Keeper was sacred.

After 2019:
The Keeper is strategic.

You learn:

- How to pitch.
- How to network.
- How to withstand form letters.
- How to protect ego.
- How to weaponize platform.
- How to stay gracious.

You do not quit.

You do not shrink.

You escalate.

---

# Memoir Spine of 2019

2019 was the year I let the world see what I had built.

It did not immediately love it.

But it did not ignore me either.

And that was enough to keep going.
