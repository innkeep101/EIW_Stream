## Part 1 — Who He Is

### The Writer

E.I. Werner is Evan Werner, 33. He decided at 15 he would be a fantasy author. Not wanted to be — decided. That decision has organized nearly everything since: eighteen years of writing almost every day, a string of career moves designed to fund the art, and a project of genuinely unusual ambition that is still in progress and still getting bigger.

The eighteen years matter more than any single credential. He has a published tabletop game credit — quests he wrote for Kinfire Chronicles, a Kickstarted game that shipped to acclaim, with characters he created surviving multiple expansions. He landed a literary agent for a completed fantasy novel that went out to every major publisher on earth. He co-wrote a feature screenplay about the first marathon runner in ancient Athens that is currently out to directors through a WME-connected manager. He is not a hobbyist. He is a working writer who has not yet published a book.

That gap — eighteen years of real, serious work, and almost nothing to show for it in the way the world measures — is the engine of everything. It is the brand. Not as tragedy. As proof.

### The Project — ONCE and Only Us

His primary writing project is ONCE: six original creation myths forming the complete cosmology of a fantasy world. These are not worldbuilding notes. He has built a moral philosophy from scratch — answers to the questions every civilization must answer: What are we for? What is evil? What happens when we die? What do we owe each other? — and followed each answer to its consequences, including the ugly ones. Gender, death, value, labor, sex, slavery, suicide, ecology, governance. Every piece flows from the cosmology. It is load-bearing all the way down.

He has been developing these myths for over two years. He is finishing them this year in a year-long writing workshop called Analog, led by Ravi Gupta, host of the Lost Debate podcast and author of Garbage Town. He joined the class for free after reconnecting with Ravi in Costa Rica.

The myths are the foundation for Only Us, a fantasy trilogy that reimagines Joseph from Genesis as a king's daughter who ascends despite betrayal. When the myths are done, the novel follows. He has decided — correctly — to finish the foundation before building on top of it, rather than trying to plan the novel while the cosmology is still open.

His differentiator as a creator is not that he reviews and ranks other people's fantasy. It is that he is actually building something. The ONCE myths are his primary shareable content until the novel exists — not teaser material, but the thing itself.

### What He Believes

> *"Writing, fantasy, and games are not escapes. They are destinations."*

This is not a slogan. It is a position that contradicts the mainstream framing of his entire genre, and he can defend it from the mythology up. Fantasy is not where you go to avoid the world. It is one of the few places where certain truths can be stated directly — truths that realism can only approximate. The greatest fantasy has always known this. He is building toward it.

He believes pure passion, held without apology for long enough, becomes proof of something. Not naivety. Not delusion. Evidence. Eighteen years of the same thing, with almost nothing to show for it, and he is still going. That is the signal. That is what the brand carries.

## Part 2 — The Brand

### Statement and Sign-Off

> **Brand statement:** "Writing, fantasy, and games are not escapes. They are destinations."

> **Sign-off:** "When you're here, you're already there."

The sign-off closes every stream. It is protected. It does the same work as the brand statement but in the present tense — the destination is not coming, it is here now, in the community, in the room.

### What the Brand Solves

The brand exists because Evan has been doing this alone for almost two decades and wants the room full of people he has never had. But the audience problem it solves is real and specific.

Fantasy lovers have had to downplay what they love their entire lives. Gamers who are otherwise ambitious and productive carry guilt about the time they spend in games. Writers in the trenches — grinding at something nobody believes in yet — feel completely alone in it. In every case, the cost of inaction is the same: they slowly shrink away from something they love because they don't have the language, the community, or the permission to stay in it fully.

E.I. Werner is the place where they don't have to shrink. Not a safe space in the passive sense. An active one — with someone who has been doing this at full intensity for eighteen years and is still going.

### What Separates This Brand

Most fantasy content creators review and rank other people's work. Evan is building his own. He streams the writing live, in Notion, with his process visible — not a performance of creativity, the actual work. Three times a week. You can watch a world get made.

The eighteen-year body of work without mainstream success is not a liability. It is the differentiator. It proves the passion is not contingent on reward. He is not here because it is working. He is here because he cannot imagine being anywhere else. That is rare enough to be worth something.

He is also someone who chose the nerdy path from a position of not needing to. He was student body president. He was captain of teams. He could have built a different life. He didn't. That choice reads.

### Channel Intro — WIP Draft

*I'm E.I. Werner and I've been an aspiring fantasy author for 18 years. I've written a lot and taken real shots but don't have much to show for it. [Elite publisher and production company rejection quotes on screen].*

*Writing is lonely. People wonder why I haven't quit. I've wondered it myself. Truth is, I can't. I have a dream — to build one of the places I see in my head and take people there.*

*I can't bring you to a castle in the sky. Not yet. I'm not there. But I can pitch camp and invite those treading along the dusty road between where we were and where we dream of going. To watch someone go for it. And keep going. Because, while most people are not wrestling with cosmogonic mythology — every person is grappling with their own destiny.*

*So step in and forget everything I said except this — fantasy, gaming, and writing are not escapes. They are destinations.*

*So welcome, and congratulations — when you're here, you're already there.*

> **Notes on the draft:** The rejection quotes on screen is smart — shows rather than tells. "Pitch camp on the dusty road" is the strongest image in any version of this script yet. The "cosmogonic mythology" line walks a narrow line — it's true and it's a differentiator, but it needs to land as accessible rather than academic. Worth testing on someone outside the fantasy niche before locking it.

## Part 3 — The Stream and Content

### The Structure

Three scheduled writing streams per week are the backbone. They prove the brand's core claim — writer who writes every day — and they do it without stealing time from the writing, because the streams are the writing. That is the load-bearing insight of the whole content strategy. The fourth stream each week is gaming: community building, personality, the other half of what the brand is.

The writing streams run with Notion open and the process visible. AI tools appear on screen as they are used — as a voice and sounding board, never for the actual writing. Viewers are watching the real thing, not a curated performance of it.

Monthly public update videos are not gated. They serve as rooting interest recruitment — a straight look at how the month went, what moved, what didn't. These are the pieces most likely to bring new people in via recommendation.

### Outside Inn — The Atmosphere Layer

Outside Inn is not a separate brand. It is the atmosphere layer of the E.I. Werner world — the community gathering space, the ambient identity of the channel, and the hearth that stays lit when Evan is not live.

When Evan is not streaming, the EIW YouTube channel runs the Outside Inn lo-fi loop: original music composed by Carson Thatcher, pixel art animation by Marwan Hasnaoui, scrolling member names during warmup. The channel is a location. Sometimes the writer is behind the bar. Sometimes it is just the music and the fireplace. Either way, the door is open.

Every live stream opens and closes with the Outside Inn warmup and cooldown. Patron names scroll. It sets the tone and rewards membership visibly. Viewers who find the lo-fi stream and write or study to it for weeks before ever seeing Evan live are not cold when he goes live. They already feel like they have been sitting in his room.

The Outside Inn also names the community's Discord server. The inn is the conceptual frame: warm, inviting, a place people return to.

### Platforms

| Platform | Role |
|---|---|
| **YouTube** | Primary — writing/gaming streams, Outside Inn lo-fi loop when not live, VODs, update videos, machinima. Always on. |
| **Twitch** | Secondary — live streams, community interaction, gaming culture |
| **TikTok** | Short-form — clipped from streams, no original creation |
| **Instagram** | Short-form — clipped from streams, no original creation |
| **YouTube Shorts** | Short-form — clipped from streams, no original creation |

Short-form platforms receive repurposed content only. The first outsourcing hire takes raw stream footage and outputs edited VODs plus clips — one person, one workflow, three outputs.

### First Three Videos

**Video 1 — The Introduction.** The 18-year story: deciding at 15, Kept getting an agent and being retired on his own terms, the sacrifice, still here. Structured as the brand's writing audition — if the words are good, nobody needs to be told he is a writer. Closes with the channel intro script above.

**Video 2 — The Myth Project.** Why he is writing seven creation myths and what fantasy actually is. The contrarian belief made tangible. Runs long — this is a positioning video, not a hook. Introduces the ONCE project and hints at the septimal numeral system.

**Video 3 — Making the Machinima.** Behind-the-scenes of building WoW machinima Episode 1 — learning a new medium in public. Tests whether the audience wants to watch him make things, not just hear him talk about making things.

## Part 4 — Community and Monetization

### Platform — Fourthwall

Everything runs through Fourthwall — memberships, merch, and the storefront. One platform, one brand experience, one URL. Fourthwall is fully white-label, has native Twitch gifting integration, zero platform fee on physical products, and saves roughly $3,500 per year versus Patreon at 500 members. Discord handles community; Signal handles the inner circle.

### Membership Tiers

#### Scrivener — $7.77/month
*The community tier. The room where you don't have to shrink.*

- Exclusive Discord channels with behind-the-scenes worldbuilding and process
- Early access to all YouTube videos
- Name displayed during the Outside Inn warmup on every stream
- Septimal loyalty badges on a base-7 cycle (month 1, 7, 14, etc.)
- 7% merch discount
- Community polls on gaming stream games and worldbuilding topics

The first 777 Scriveners receive a permanent numbered Founding Scrivener badge. Lower numbers are earlier. Once all 777 are claimed, they are gone.

#### Keeper — $21.21/month
*The inner circle. Everything above, plus:*

- Monthly patron-only livestream — 45 to 60 minutes, AMA-style, the conversation not the performance
- Signal group thread — lives on their phone, the back table at the inn
- Name in video credits
- Royalty-free use of Outside Inn music tracks in their own content
- Exclusive merch drops announced in Signal first
- 14% merch discount
- Writing review after 7 consecutive months — up to one chapter, privately or on stream, their choice

The first 77 Keepers receive a permanent numbered Founding Keeper badge. Once 77 are claimed, they are gone.

### The Pricing

$7.77 and $21.21. Base-7 runs through the entire fantasy world — the septimal numeral system, the creation myths, the cosmology. The prices carry that DNA. $7.77 is elevated enough to not feel like a tip jar. $21.21 is a real commitment that justifies real access. Scriveners get 7% merch discount. Keepers get 14%. The sevens are in the details.

### Merch — Two Lines, One Store

| Product | Price | Est. Margin |
|---|---|---|
| Classic Mousepad (EIW or Outside Inn) | $21.21 | ~53% |
| Gaming Mousepad (EIW or Outside Inn) | $28.28 | ~57% |
| Deskmat 15.5" x 31.5" (EIW or Outside Inn) | $49.49 | ~70% |
| Poster 18x24 unframed (EIW or Outside Inn) | $21.21 | ~50% |
| Poster 18x24 framed (EIW or Outside Inn) | $42.42 | ~41% |

The EIW line is black and white, painterly, literary. The Outside Inn line is warm pixel art, lo-fi atmosphere. Two visual languages under one store. No wordmarks. Elevated enough that someone would buy it without knowing the brand. The deskmat is the hero product at roughly 70% margin.

### Community Architecture

**Discord — The Outside Inn.** Free and open to anyone. Tier-gated channels unlock for Scriveners and Keepers via Fourthwall's Discord integration. The open Discord is the lobby. The gated channels are the real room.

**Signal — The Back Table.** Keepers only. Not Discord — lives on their phone. Members talk to each other. Late-night paragraph screenshots, real-time thoughts, the stuff too small for a post but too personal for Discord.

## Part 5 — Finances (Internal)

### Burn Context

Roughly $10,000 was invested in Outside Inn music and art — Carson Thatcher as composer, Marwan Hasnaoui as animator, and a failed earlier engagement before Marwan was found. This was spent before the brand exercise in February 2026 clarified that Outside Inn is an atmosphere layer, not the brand itself. The pivot was right. The cost of the pivot was $10k and several months. The lesson is the build-before-validate pattern: building to the scale of the person he wants to be before validating the premise. The fix is one question that precedes every new infrastructure build — what is the cheapest way to test whether this works before making it beautiful?

## Part 5b — Collaborator Philosophy

### How This Works With People

Evan leads. He is the boss and the creative director of this brand — not a committee, not a collective. Decisions move through him. The vision is his. But he is also building the kind of operation he wished existed when he was younger: somewhere a person can do real work, be trusted with real responsibility, and share in what gets built if it succeeds.

That means backend participation. Artists whose work sells product earn a flat fee or small percentage on each sale of the product featuring their art. This is not standard practice in creator merch. It is the right practice. The people who make the work that makes the brand should have a stake in it. This creates alignment, not just employment — when the brand wins, the people who built it win.

He pays artists. Not AI. Marwan is doing the pixel art. Luiz is doing the digital painting and learning the Twitch overlay work. Carson composed the Outside Inn music. These are real people doing real creative work and they are compensated as such. AI is used for writing support and brand thinking — as a voice and sounding board — but the creative output that carries the brand belongs to humans.

He wants to be relied upon. When he says something will happen, it happens. When a collaborator is on deadline, they hear from him. When there is a problem, he addresses it directly rather than letting it fester. The Carson situation earlier this year was a lesson in what goes wrong when stress turns into clinical distance — the recovery worked because the foundation was real, but the lesson is to lead with warmth first, not after the damage is done.

The aspiration is simple: to be the boss and mentor he never had. Someone who gives real creative people real opportunities, pays them fairly, includes them in the upside, and treats the collaboration as a relationship worth protecting.

### Carson Thatcher — Status Note

Carson is finishing tracks as a favor following the business disagreement in February 2026. The friendship survived. The ongoing business partnership ended. What Carson will deliver, on what timeline, and under what terms for the remaining tracks is not yet confirmed. This section of the document will be updated once they speak — that conversation is a priority in the days immediately following launch. It is launch crunch time and this is intentionally held open rather than speculated on.

> **TODO:** Speak with Carson. Confirm deliverables, timeline, and terms for remaining tracks. Update this section. Do not negotiate over text or email.

## Part 7 — Stream Alerts

Two alerts are active at launch. Both use animation assets built for the EIW brand. Each fires on screen during a live stream when the relevant membership event occurs.

### New Scrivener Alert

- **Animation:** Typewriter typing sequence — Holdt's hands on the typewriter, full motion
- **Sound:** A single ding
- **Text:** "[Name] has wet their quill. Welcome, Scrivener."

The alert is understated and literary. The typewriter animation signals craft. The ding is clean, not bombastic. The copy has a touch of ceremony without being overwrought — wetting a quill is the moment before writing begins, exactly where a new Scrivener stands.

### New Keeper Alert

- **Animation:** Duck family sequence — the full scene including the baby duck waking up
- **Sound:** Mom's vocals — the singing from the duck animation audio
- **Text:** "[Name] has joined the Keepers. Kept, we keep on."

The Keeper alert is warmer and more personal than the Scrivener alert. The duck family carries emotional weight — the mom singing over the baby duck waking up is a genuine moment. "Kept, we keep on" does double work: it nods to Kept, the retired trilogy that lives in the brand's DNA, and it names the Keeper ethos — the people who stay, who keep returning, who keep going alongside Evan.
