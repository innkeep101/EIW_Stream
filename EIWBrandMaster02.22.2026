## North Star

**The desired outcome this brand exists to accomplish:**

Build a community around E.I. Werner as a fantasy writer and creative leader that makes the writing career financially sustainable and less lonely. The room full of people who chose to care about the things done alone for 18 years. Motivate people to fully commit to their own dreams through the undimmed passion of an 18-year grind with almost nothing to show for it — and give fantasy lovers, productive gamers, and writers in the trenches a front-row seat to how the work actually gets made, with real opportunities to engage and contribute along the way. So that when the books are ready, the audience is already there and already cares.

**What must Evan be known for in order for that to happen:**

A fantasy author who actually builds his world in public. Someone who has been going for 18 years without external validation and is still going. A leader with earnest charisma who lifts people up around the things the world told them to downplay.

**What he must consistently do:**

Stream the writing live, three times a week. Game with the community. Build the ONCE mythology in public. Say the brand statement until the audience says it back. Be the proof of concept.

**What he's still learning:**

Validate before building. Lead with warmth, not clinical efficiency under pressure. The audience doesn't need to see the walls — they need to see the writer behind them.

---

## Who He Is

Evan Ilan Werner, 33. Goes by E.I. Werner for his writing. Decided at 15 he would be a fantasy author — not wanted to be, decided. That decision has organized nearly everything since: 18 years of writing almost every day, career moves designed to fund the art, a creative project of genuinely unusual ambition that is still in progress and still getting bigger.

He has a published tabletop game credit — quests he wrote for Kinfire Chronicles, a Kickstarted game that shipped to acclaim, with characters he created surviving multiple expansions. He landed a literary agent for a completed fantasy novel that went out to every major publisher on earth. He co-wrote a feature screenplay about the first marathon runner in ancient Athens, currently out to directors. He is not a hobbyist. He is a working writer who has not yet published a book.

That gap — 18 years of real, serious work and almost nothing to show for it in the way the world measures — is not tragedy. It is proof. It is the brand.

He was student body president. Captain of teams. He chose the nerdy path from a position of not needing to. That choice reads.

His rebel instinct runs deep: when everyone goes one way, he tends to go the other. This is often a superpower.

---

## Brand Statement & Sign-Off

> **Brand Statement:** "Writing, fantasy, and games are not escapes. They are destinations."

> **Sign-Off:** "When you're here, you're already there."

These are not slogans. They are positions. The brand statement contradicts the mainstream framing of an entire genre and can be defended from the mythology up. Fantasy is not where you go to avoid the world. It is one of the few places where certain truths can be stated directly — truths that realism can only approximate. The greatest fantasy has always known this.

The sign-off closes every stream. It is protected. It does the same work as the brand statement but in the present tense — the destination is not coming, it is here now, in the community, in the room.

**Say the brand statement until the audience says it back.** That is the goal. The proof that it is working is when they start defending it without being asked.

---

## The Three Audiences & Their Pain

The brand serves three overlapping audiences. They often exist in the same person.

---

### Audience 1 — The Fantasy Lover

*Someone who has had to apologize for what they love their entire life.*

**Their painful problems (in their words):**

- "I feel guilty about the amount of time I spend reading/watching fantasy."
- "I can't explain to people why fantasy matters without sounding childish."
- "My favorite author hasn't finished the series and I'm losing hope they ever will."
- "I feel like there's nothing good left to read in fantasy."
- "I love something deeply but I can't articulate why it hits me so hard."
- "I don't have anyone in my life who wants to go deep on this stuff with me."
- "I've outgrown most fantasy content creators — they feel juvenile."
- "I want fantasy that's sophisticated, not corny."
- "I wish I could watch someone build a fantasy world instead of just reviewing others'."

**Cost of inaction:** They slowly shrink away from something that shaped them. They disengage. They stop talking about it. Quiet self-betrayal.

---

### Audience 2 — The Productive Gamer

*Someone who games seriously and carries guilt about it because the world told them to.*

**Their painful problems (in their words):**

- "I feel guilty about how much time I spend gaming."
- "I'm ambitious and productive but people assume gamers are lazy."
- "I want to game but can't justify it when I feel behind on everything else."
- "I can't find people who game the way I do — with intention, not just to waste time."

**Cost of inaction:** They keep shrinking a real source of joy. They either stop gaming and lose the community, or they keep gaming and keep feeling bad about it. Neither version is sustainable.

---

### Audience 3 — The Writer in the Trenches

*Someone grinding at something nobody believes in yet, or who gave up because the sacrifice got too heavy.*

**Their painful problems (in their words):**

- "I'm grinding at something nobody believes in yet and I feel completely alone in it."
- "No one understands what I've sacrificed to keep writing."
- "I want to be a writer but I have no idea what the grind actually looks like — no one shows me."
- "I gave up on writing because the cost was too high and I still think about it."
- "I don't know if what I'm doing is crazy or courageous — and I have no one to ask."
- "I need to see someone who is still going to believe I can keep going."

**Cost of inaction:** The writer who gave up carries it quietly. The writer who's about to give up has nothing to hold onto. The naïve writer walks into the sacrifice blindly and gets blindsided by it.

**What E.I. Werner provides to this audience:** He doesn't give advice. He doesn't teach craft. He exists visibly as proof that someone is still going. That is the value. 18 years deep. Still here. That's the signal.

---

### The Through-Line Across All Three

Almost every cost of inaction comes back to the same root: **people shrinking away from something they love because they don't have the language, the community, or the permission to stay in it fully.**

E.I. Werner is the place where they don't have to shrink. Not a safe space in the passive sense — an active one. With someone who has been doing this at full intensity for 18 years and is still going.

---

## Differentiation — The Contrarian Positions

*What others in this space do vs. what this brand does instead. The thread: obsession that stays honest.*

| What the Space Says / Does | The E.I. Werner Position |
|---|---|
| Fantasy creators review and rank other people's work | He builds his own. The ONCE mythology is the content — not commentary on someone else's. |
| Success stories dominate creator culture | He documents the grind without mainstream success — and treats that as the differentiator, not the liability. |
| Authenticity is performed | His 18-year record is the authenticity. The rejection ledger is public. The retirements are public. The process is live on screen. There's nowhere to hide. |
| "Escape" is how fantasy gets framed | Fantasy is a destination. Not a temporary exit. A place with its own truth and gravity. |
| Gaming is a guilty pleasure | Gaming is a legitimate form of community and connection. Full stop. No apology. |
| Writers should either teach craft or be famous before building an audience | A working writer — not yet published, not yet famous — can build an audience around the process itself if that process is real and visible. |
| Worldbuilding is backstage | The mythology is the content. ONCE is shareable now. The world exists before the book. |
| Content creators maintain distance | He games with the community. He writes with the community watching. The relationship is participatory. |
| More content = more growth | The right content, consistently, for the right audience builds trust. Three writing streams and one gaming stream per week. No more, no less. |
| Virality is the goal | Trust is the goal. He is not building a following. He is building a room. |
| Fantasy fandom skews toward passive consumption | This community co-creates — they vote on worldbuilding, they're credited, their names scroll on stream. |
| Creator brands are polished | He is human as possible. The grind, the uncertainty, the 18 years, the rejections — all of it is on the table. |
| Separate the creator from the work | He is the work. E.I. Werner is not a pen name — it's the version of himself that could matter. |
| Go wide to grow | He goes deep. The right 100 people in the room are worth more than 10,000 strangers who don't care. |

## Desired Associations

**What E.I. Werner should be known FOR:**

1. **Craft with soul** — the writing is the real thing, and it shows. Not content. Not product. Work.
2. **Permission to love what you love** — fantasy, gaming, the weird nerdy thing you've been downplaying. You're allowed.
3. **Endurance** — 18 years. Still going. That is the most powerful thing about this brand and it requires no embellishment.

**What E.I. Werner should be known AGAINST:**

1. **Content for content's sake** — he is not posting to post. Every stream serves the writing or the community.
2. **Fantasy and gaming as lesser things** — he will not minimize them, qualify them, or frame them as "just" anything.
3. **Complaining instead of adapting** — the rejections are public but they are not the story. The continuation is.

---

## Credibility Bank

*The proof that Evan has done the work — vetted for shareability.*

### Wins (Green — Share Freely)

**Kinfire Chronicles: Night's Fall** — Wrote quests for this tabletop RPG. Kickstarted, shipped to acclaim. Characters he created remain in the game after multiple expansions. This is his only public creative credit to date and it is fully shareable.

**Literary agent for The Keeper** — Brendan Deneen, former senior editor at Tor and President of Literary & IP Development at Assemble, offered representation after meeting in person in New York, December 2019. The Keeper was queried widely and received real attention before being retired on Evan's own terms.

**CAA Coverage — CONSIDER** — The Keeper received a CONSIDER rating from CAA coverage during the query campaign. Shareably impressive.

**The Keeper retired on his own terms** — He didn't get passed on by every publisher and quit. He read the feedback, did a paid editorial assessment, sat with it, and made the call himself. He wrote the retirement letter in May 2023. That's ownership of the narrative, not defeat.

**The Marathon Screenplay** — Co-written with Otis Blum. Currently out to directors through WME-connected manager John Burnham. An earlier pass attracted producers. It is a real screenplay that has made it into real rooms.

**The ONCE Mythology** — Six original creation myths forming the complete cosmology of a fantasy world. Not worldbuilding notes. A moral philosophy built from scratch, with answers to the questions every civilization must answer. Two years of deep daily work. Being finished in 2026 in Analog, a year-long workshop led by Ravi Gupta (host of the Lost Debate podcast, author of *Garbage Town*).

**18 years of daily writing** — The most unimpeachable credential. Every publisher praised the writing. Every rejection of The Keeper acknowledged real craft. The consistency is the proof.

### Scars (Green — The Brand Runs on These)

**The Rejection Ledger** — 7 film passes, 12+ agent passes, 10+ publisher passes. Tor, FSG, Harper, Bloomsbury, Del Rey, Viking, Sourcebooks. The CEO of Penguin Random House replied personally. Every major publisher on earth saw The Keeper. None bought it. And he kept going. The ledger is not a wound. It is a record. It belongs in the content.

**The rebrand from The Keeper** — He spent years on a book that didn't find a home. Then he retired it. Then he started something bigger. This is not failure. This is evolution visible in real time.

**The $10k Outside Inn investment before the brand was clear** — Built an atmosphere layer before building the brand it was meant to serve. The lesson is documented in the master brand document: validate before building. The build-before-validate pattern is a real behavioral tendency worth naming publicly — because the audience who is also prone to premature commitment will recognize themselves in it.

---

## The Outside Inn — Its Role in the Brand

**Outside Inn is not a separate brand. It is the atmosphere layer of the E.I. Werner world.**

It is the hearth that stays lit when Evan is not live. It is the community gathering space. It is proof that Evan can ship quality products and curate a vibe. It is ambient identity.

**The critical distinction:** E.I. Werner is the voice. The Outside Inn is the place.

**What it does for the brand:**

It makes the brand statement real. "Writing, fantasy, and games are not escapes. They are destinations." The Outside Inn is literally a destination that exists right now — before the books, before Only Us is finished, before the mainstream success. Most aspiring fantasy authors are all promise and no product. The Outside Inn is a product.

It proves the worldbuilding. Original music by Carson Thatcher, pixel art by Marwan Hasnaoui, a character named Holdt who writes alongside listeners — that is not talking about building a fantasy world. That is letting people experience a piece of one.

It builds passive loyalty. Viewers who find the lo-fi stream and write or study to it for weeks before ever seeing Evan live are not cold when he goes live. They already feel like they have been sitting in his room.

It funds the writing career while the books aren't ready.

**The organic discovery loop:** During EIW writing streams, Outside Inn plays in the background. Evan is a user of his own product. When a viewer asks about the music, the answer is a whole channel they can leave on forever. The funnel happens through natural conversation, not promotion.

**The rule:** Outside Inn never breaks character. The station does not cross-promote with links or announcements. It is the stone inn. The fire is lit. The door is open. That is the entire job.

---

## Content Strategy

### The Cadence

**3 writing streams per week + 1 gaming stream per week.**

This is the load-bearing commitment. The writing streams prove the core claim — writer who writes every day — without stealing time from the writing, because the streams are the writing. Notion is open on screen. The process is visible. AI tools appear as used: as voice and sounding board, never for the actual writing.

The gaming stream is community building and personality. The other half of what the brand is.

### Monthly public update videos — ungated.

Straight look at how the month went, what moved, what didn't. These are the pieces most likely to bring new people in via recommendation. They serve as rooting interest recruitment.

### The 75/20/5 Content Mix

**75% — Deep content.** ONCE mythology breakdowns, worldbuilding process, writing philosophy, the rejection ledger lived out loud, craft notes, Only Us development. This builds trust with the audience that will eventually buy the books.

**20% — Niche-wide content.** Broadly relevant to fantasy lovers, gamers, and writers — but still within Evan's world. What makes great fantasy. How gaming builds community. What the writing life actually looks like. Reaches new people who are adjacent to the offer.

**5% — Personal content (sprinkled in, not dedicated videos).** Gaming references, music taste, the nerdy obsessions, the human layer. Not standalone pieces — elements woven through the 75% and 20%. What makes the brand impossible to copy.

### The Content Success Formula

**Painful Problem + Unique Solution × Contextual Credibility × Proven Wrapper = Content That Converts**

Contextual credibility is more powerful than general credibility. "I've been writing fantasy for 18 years" is general. "I built a complete cosmological moral philosophy from scratch across six creation myths and I'm still refining it" is contextual. Lead with the specific.

### Ideation Engine

Every painful problem from The Three Audiences section is a stream, a video, a conversation, a piece of content. There are 16 problems listed across the three audiences. That alone is 16 substantial content threads. Cross-reference them with the credibility bank and the contrarian positions — every intersection is a new angle.

---

## Platform Strategy

### Eye of Sauron — YouTube First

YouTube is the primary platform. It gets the pillar content: the long-form writing/gaming streams, the monthly update videos, the Outside Inn lo-fi loop when not live. All energy, all innovation, all creative risk goes here first.

Twitch is secondary — simulcast from OBS, live community interaction, gaming culture home. No rebuild required. It receives the stream, not the innovation.

TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts receive repurposed clips only. No original creation for these platforms in year one. One editor takes raw stream footage and outputs VODs plus clips — one person, one workflow, three outputs.

**This phase ends when YouTube feels dialed in.** Then the Eye rotates to short-form with real intention. Not before.

### Platform Table

| Platform | Role | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| YouTube | Primary — streams, VODs, lo-fi loop, update videos | Active + Innovating |
| Twitch | Secondary — simulcast, community, gaming | Active + Maintaining |
| TikTok | Repurposed clips only | Passive |
| Instagram | Repurposed clips only | Passive |
| YouTube Shorts | Repurposed clips only | Passive |

## The First Three Videos

### Video 1 — The Introduction: "You're Already There"

**What it is:** The 18-year story made useful to the viewer. Not a biography. Not a brag reel. The story as a shortcut for them.

**The script draft opens:** "I'm E.I. Werner and I've been an aspiring fantasy author for 18 years. I've written a lot and taken real shots but don't have much to show for it."

Rejection quotes appear on screen. Not as wounds. As evidence of real swings.

The pivotal moments: deciding at 15. The Keeper going out to every major publisher. The retirement letter. The ONCE mythology beginning. Each moment carries a lesson that is immediately useful to the viewer.

Closes with the channel intro: the brand statement, the sign-off. "When you're here, you're already there."

**The test:** Would you be comfortable sending this to people whose opinion you actually care about? Yes. That is the bar.

### Video 2 — The Positioning Deep Dive: Why Fantasy Actually Matters

**What it is:** A deep, useful breakdown of the core subject Evan wants to be known for, taught through the lens of the contrarian belief.

Opens with: "Writing, fantasy, and games are not escapes. They are destinations." Everything that follows is the argument for that claim.

Introduces the ONCE project. Explains what it means to build a moral philosophy from scratch. Walks through what fantasy actually does that realism cannot. Gives 3–5 breakthrough ideas that reframe the viewer's understanding of the genre they love.

Runs long — this is a positioning video, not a hook. 25+ minutes. Length is a feature when every minute earns it.

### Video 3 — The Experimental: Making the Machinima

**What it is:** Behind-the-scenes of building WoW machinima Episode 1 — learning a new medium in public.

Different in every way from Videos 1 and 2: pacing, environment, structure, delivery. Tests whether the audience wants to watch Evan make things, not just hear him talk about making things.

After filming: does it feel energizing or draining? That answer matters as much as the view count.

---

## Community & Membership

Everything runs through Fourthwall. One platform, one brand experience, one URL. Discord handles community. Signal handles the inner circle.

### Scrivener — $7.77/month
*The community tier. The room where you don't have to shrink.*

- Exclusive Discord channels with behind-the-scenes worldbuilding and process
- Early access to all YouTube videos
- Name displayed during the Outside Inn warmup on every stream
- Septimal loyalty badges on a base-7 cycle (month 1, 7, 14, 21...)
- 7% merch discount
- Community polls on gaming stream games and worldbuilding topics

The first 777 Scriveners receive a permanent numbered Founding Scrivener badge. Lower numbers are earlier. Once 777 are claimed, they are gone.

### Keeper — $21.21/month
*The inner circle. Everything above, plus:*

- Monthly patron-only livestream — 45–60 minutes, AMA-style. The conversation, not the performance.
- Signal group thread — lives on their phone. The back table at the inn.
- Name in video credits
- Royalty-free use of Outside Inn music tracks in their own content *(pending Carson confirmation)*
- Exclusive merch drops announced in Signal first
- 14% merch discount
- Writing review after 7 consecutive months — up to one chapter, privately or on stream, their choice

The first 77 Keepers receive a permanent numbered Founding Keeper badge. Once 77 are claimed, they are gone.

### The Pricing Logic

$7.77 and $21.21. Base-7 runs through the entire fantasy world — the septimal numeral system, the creation myths, the cosmology. The prices carry that DNA. $7.77 is elevated enough to not feel like a tip jar. $21.21 is a real commitment that justifies real access. Scriveners get 7% merch discount. Keepers get 14%. The sevens are in the details.

### Discord Architecture

**The Outside Inn** is the Discord server name. The inn is the conceptual frame: warm, inviting, a place people return to. The open Discord is the lobby. Tier-gated channels unlock for Scriveners and Keepers via Fourthwall integration. The gated channels are the real room.

### Stream Alerts

**New Scrivener:** Typewriter animation (Holdt's hands on the typewriter). A single ding. Text: "[Name] has wet their quill. Welcome, Scrivener."

**New Keeper:** Duck family animation (the full scene, baby duck waking up). Mom's vocals from the animation audio. Text: "[Name] has joined the Keepers. Kept, we keep on."

"Kept, we keep on" does double work: it nods to Kept, the retired trilogy that lives in the brand's DNA, and it names the Keeper ethos — the people who stay, who keep returning, who keep going alongside Evan.

---

## Voice & Tone

**Warm but not soft.** The brand has teeth. The warmth is real but it comes from a place of conviction, not performance. Evan cares deeply and is also willing to disagree with the room.

**Direct over diplomatic.** He says what he means. He edits for clarity, not to sand down the edges. This is not the brand that hedges.

**Earnest without being naïve.** The passion is not ironic. The 18-year commitment is not a joke. He means it — and that sincerity is the differentiator in a space full of irony-poisoned content. But he is not naïve about the business, the industry, or the difficulty of what he's doing.

**Singular "you."** Always "you," never "you guys." Speaks to one person. Creates intimacy. Re-delivers any line that accidentally uses the plural.

**Human as possible.** In an era of AI-generated content, being authentically human is the ultimate competitive advantage. Leave the silly moments in. Reference the things you'd naturally talk about with friends. The personality is not separate from the brand — it is the brand.

**What to avoid in copy and on stream:**

- Resume language — listing credentials without making them useful to the viewer
- Hedging — "I think maybe," "kind of," "sort of"
- Downplaying — "just a fantasy author," "just streaming," "just for fun"
- Performative humility — false modesty reads worse than honest confidence
- Clinical efficiency when warmth is what the moment calls for

---

## Brand Guardrails — What This Brand Is Not

These exist to protect Evan from building something he secretly resents.

**This is not a content farm.** The streams exist because they are the writing. The moment a stream feels like it is competing with the writing for time and energy, something has gone wrong. The brand and the business should be complementary, not competing.

**This is not a tips-and-tricks channel.** The ONCE mythology is not "10 worldbuilding tips." The writing process is not a tutorial. The content is the thing itself — shown in real time, with all the uncertainty that comes with it.

**This is not a review channel.** Other people's work is not the primary content. It may show up as reference or context. It is not the main event.

**This is not a performance.** Delivery = removing everything that keeps Evan from being fully himself. Not turning energy up to 10 because the camera requires it. Not building a character he'll have to maintain forever. The natural version is the right version.

**This is not a platform for half-baked hot takes.** The Tattoo Test applies. Would he still stand behind it in 15 years? If yes — say it loud. If not sure — hold it back. The brand accumulates. What's said publicly creates the lens the audience views everything else through, and they will hold him to it longer than he expects.

**This is not a brand built for the algorithm.** The reframe: "I am not building a brand to please the algorithm. I am building a brand that allows me to talk about writing, fantasy, and games while still being a full human." If the content only works when pretending to be less interesting than he actually is, it is not a brand — it is a performance.
